                  therapy frequently emerges from a small subset of those
                  cells1-7. Molecular differences in rare individual cells in
                  the initial population enable certain cells to become
                  resistant to therapy7-9; however, comparatively little is
                  known about the variability in the resistance outcomes. Here
                  we develop and apply FateMap, a framework that combines DNA
                  barcoding with single-cell RNA sequencing, to reveal the fates
                  of hundreds of thousands of clones exposed to anti-cancer
                  therapies. We show that resistant clones emerging from
                  single-cell-derived cancer cells adopt molecularly,
                  morphologically and functionally distinct resistant types.
                  These resistant types are largely predetermined by molecular
                  differences between cells before drug addition and not by
                  extrinsic factors. Changes in the dose and type of drug can
                  switch the resistant type of an initial cell, resulting in the
                  generation and elimination of certain resistant types. Samples
                  from patients show evidence for the existence of these
                  resistant types in a clinical context. We observed diversity
                  in resistant types across several single-cell-derived cancer
                  cell lines and cell types treated with a variety of drugs. The
                  diversity of resistant types as a result of the variability in
                  intrinsic cell states may be a generic feature of responses to
                  external cues.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: In patients with acquired aplastic anemia,
                  destruction of hematopoietic cells by the immune system leads
                  to pancytopenia. Patients have a response to immunosuppressive
                  therapy, but myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid
                  leukemia develop in about 15\% of the patients, usually many
                  months to years after the diagnosis of aplastic anemia.
                  METHODS: We performed next-generation sequencing and
                  array-based karyotyping using 668 blood samples obtained from
                  439 patients with aplastic anemia. We analyzed serial samples
                  obtained from 82 patients. RESULTS: Somatic mutations in
                  myeloid cancer candidate genes were present in one third of
                  the patients, in a limited number of genes and at low initial
                  variant allele frequency. Clonal hematopoiesis was detected in
                  47\% of the patients, most frequently as acquired mutations.
                  The prevalence of the mutations increased with age, and
                  mutations had an age-related signature. DNMT3A-mutated and
                  ASXL1-mutated clones tended to increase in size over time; the
                  size of BCOR- and BCORL1-mutated and PIGA-mutated clones
                  decreased or remained stable. Mutations in PIGA and BCOR and
                  BCORL1 correlated with a better response to immunosuppressive
                  therapy and longer and a higher rate of overall and
                  progression-free survival; mutations in a subgroup of genes
                  that included DNMT3A and ASXL1 were associated with worse
                  outcomes. However, clonal dynamics were highly variable and
                  might not necessarily have predicted the response to therapy
                  and long-term survival among individual patients. CONCLUSIONS:
                  Clonal hematopoiesis was prevalent in aplastic anemia. Some
                  mutations were related to clinical outcomes. A highly biased
                  set of mutations is evidence of Darwinian selection in the
                  failed bone marrow environment. The pattern of somatic clones
                  in individual patients over time was variable and frequently
                  unpredictable. (Funded by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research

                  understanding of the role of ASXL1 lesions in malignant

                  commonly in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), and are
                  associated with adverse outcome. Germline ASXL1 mutations

                  that constitutive loss of Asxl1 results in developmental
                  abnormalities, including anophthalmia, microcephaly, cleft
                  palates, and mandibular malformations. In contrast,
                  hematopoietic-specific deletion of Asxl1 results in
                  progressive, multilineage cytopenias and dysplasia in the
                  context of increased numbers of hematopoietic stem/progenitor
                  cells, characteristic features of human MDS. Serial
                  transplantation of Asxl1-null hematopoietic cells results in a
                  lethal myeloid disorder at a shorter latency than primary
                  Asxl1 knockout (KO) mice. Asxl1 deletion reduces hematopoietic
                  stem cell self-renewal, which is restored by concomitant
                  deletion of Tet2, a gene commonly co-mutated with ASXL1 in MDS
                  patients. Moreover, compound Asxl1/Tet2 deletion results in an
                  MDS phenotype with hastened death compared with single-gene KO
                  mice. Asxl1 loss results in a global reduction of H3K27
                  trimethylation and dysregulated expression of known regulators
                  of hematopoiesis. RNA-Seq/ChIP-Seq analyses of Asxl1 in

                  expressed genes as direct targets of Asxl1. These findings

                  forms of myeloid malignancies, and its alterations are
                  associated with poor prognosis. De novo ASXL1 mutations cause
                  Bohring-Opitz syndrome characterized by multiple congenital
                  malformations. We show that Asxl1 deletion in mice led to
                  developmental abnormalities including dwarfism, anophthalmia,
                  and 80\% embryonic lethality. Surviving Asxl1(-/-) mice lived
                  for up to 42 days and developed features of myelodysplastic
                  syndrome (MDS), including dysplastic neutrophils and multiple
                  lineage cytopenia. Asxl1(-/-) mice had a reduced hematopoietic
                  stem cell (HSC) pool, and Asxl1(-/-) HSCs exhibited decreased
                  hematopoietic repopulating capacity, with skewed cell
                  differentiation favoring granulocytic lineage. Asxl1(+/-) mice
                  also developed mild MDS-like disease, which could progress to
                  MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm, demonstrating a
                  haploinsufficient effect of Asxl1 in the pathogenesis of
                  myeloid malignancies. Asxl1 loss led to an increased apoptosis
                  and mitosis in Lineage(-)c-Kit(+) (Lin(-)c-Kit(+)) cells,
                  consistent with human MDS. Furthermore, Asxl1(-/-)
                  Lin(-)c-Kit(+) cells exhibited decreased global levels of
                  H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 and altered expression of genes
                  regulating apoptosis (Bcl2, Bcl2l12, Bcl2l13). Collectively,
                  we report a novel ASXL1 murine model that recapitulates human
                  myeloid malignancies, implying that Asxl1 functions as a tumor
                  suppressor to maintain hematopoietic cell homeostasis. Future
                  work is necessary to clarify the contribution of
                  microenvironment to the hematopoietic phenotypes observed in

                  depositing H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3, respectively. PRC1 and
                  PRC2 exist in different variants and show a complex regulatory

                  mediating PcG repressive functions remains largely
                  controversial. Using a fully catalytic inactive RING1B mutant,

                  hematopoietic transformation, there is growing evidence that

                  effective tool for stable knock down of gene expression.
                  Lentiviral vectors can be used to deliver shRNAs, thereby
                  providing the ability to infect most mammalian cell types with
                  high efficiency, regardless of proliferation state.
                  Furthermore, the use of inducible promoters to drive shRNA
                  expression allows for more thorough investigations into the
                  specific timing of gene function in a variety of cellular
                  processes. Moreover, inducible knockdown allows the
                  investigation of genes that would be lethal or otherwise
                  poorly tolerated if constitutively knocked down. Lentiviral
                  inducible shRNA vectors are readily available, but
                  unfortunately the process of cloning, screening, and testing
                  shRNAs can be time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, we
                  sought to refine a popular vector (Tet-pLKO-Puro) and
                  streamline the cloning process with efficient protocols so
                  that researchers can more efficiently utilize this powerful
                  tool. METHODS : First, we modified the Tet-pLKO-Puro vector to
                  make it easy ("EZ") for molecular cloning (EZ-Tet-pLKO-Puro).
                  Our primary modification was to shrink the stuffer region,
                  which allows vector purification via polyethylene glycol
                  precipitation thereby avoiding the need to purify DNA through
                  agarose. In addition, we generated EZ-Tet-pLKO vectors with
                  hygromycin or blasticidin resistance to provide greater
                  flexibility in cell line engineering. Furthermore, we provide
                  a detailed guide for utilizing these vectors, including shRNA
                  design strategy and simplified screening methods. RESULTS:
                  Notably, we emphasize the importance of loop sequence design
                  and demonstrate that the addition of a single mismatch in the
                  loop stem can greatly improve shRNA efficiency. Lastly, we
                  display the robustness of the system with a doxycycline
                  titration and recovery time course and provide a cost/benefit
                  analysis comparing our system with purchasing pre-designed
                  shRNA vectors. CONCLUSIONS: Our aim was twofold: first, to
                  take a very useful shRNA vector and make it more amenable for
                  molecular cloning and, secondly, to provide a streamlined
                  protocol and rationale for cost-effective design, cloning, and
                  screening of shRNAs. With this knowledge, anyone can take
                  advantage of this powerful tool to inducibly knockdown any
                  gene of their choosing.},

                  This process of haematopoiesis is tightly regulated in vivo
                  and primarily takes place in the bone marrow. Over the years,
                  a range of in vitro culture systems have been developed,

                  multivariable analyses, ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutation as a single
                  variable did not have a significant impact on prognosis.
                  However, we observed a significant interaction (P=0.04) for

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Cancers arise from multiple acquired mutations,
                  which presumably occur over many years. Early stages in cancer
                  development might be present years before cancers become
                  clinically apparent. METHODS: We analyzed data from
                  whole-exome sequencing of DNA in peripheral-blood cells from
                  12,380 persons, unselected for cancer or hematologic
                  phenotypes. We identified somatic mutations on the basis of
                  unusual allelic fractions. We used data from Swedish national
                  patient registers to follow health outcomes for 2 to 7 years
                  after DNA sampling. RESULTS: Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic
                  mutations was observed in 10\% of persons older than 65 years
                  of age but in only 1\% of those younger than 50 years of age.
                  Detectable clonal expansions most frequently involved somatic
                  mutations in three genes (DNMT3A, ASXL1, and TET2) that have
                  previously been implicated in hematologic cancers. Clonal
                  hematopoiesis was a strong risk factor for subsequent
                  hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 12.9; 95\% confidence
                  interval, 5.8 to 28.7). Approximately 42\% of hematologic
                  cancers in this cohort arose in persons who had clonality at
                  the time of DNA sampling, more than 6 months before a first
                  diagnosis of cancer. Analysis of bone marrow-biopsy specimens
                  obtained from two patients at the time of diagnosis of acute
                  myeloid leukemia revealed that their cancers arose from the
                  earlier clones. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic
                  mutations is readily detected by means of DNA sequencing, is
                  increasingly common as people age, and is associated with
                  increased risks of hematologic cancer and death. A subset of
                  the genes that are mutated in patients with myeloid cancers is
                  frequently mutated in apparently healthy persons; these
                  mutations may represent characteristic early events in the
                  development of hematologic cancers. (Funded by the National

                  capable of generating siRNA specific for GFP after
                  transduction of 293T-GFP cell lines showed no GFP
                  fluorescence. Furthermore, no GFP-specific RNA could be

                  transduced with lentivirus-expressing siGFP virus, reduced

                  sequencing efforts have mapped the genomic landscape of adult
                  and pediatric AML revealing a number of biologically and
                  prognostically relevant driver lesions. Beyond identifying
                  recurrent genetic aberrations, it is of critical importance to
                  fully delineate the complex mechanisms by which they
                  contribute to the initiation and evolution of disease to
                  ultimately facilitate the development of targeted therapies.
                  Towards these aims, murine models of AML are indispensable
                  research tools. The rapid evolution of genetic engineering
                  techniques over the past 20 years has greatly advanced the use

                  cells (HSPCs) represents a promising versatile approach for
                  blood disorders. METHODS: To derive definitive HSPCs from
                  human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we differentiated
                  mesodermally specified embryoid bodies (EBs) on gelatin-coated
                  plates in serum/feeder-free conditions. RESULTS: Seven-day EB
                  maturation followed by an 8-day differentiation period on OP9
                  cells provided the highest number of definitive (CD34+
                  CD235a-, 69\%, p < 0.01) and lowest number of primitive (CD34-
                  CD235a+, 1.55\%, p < 0.01) precursor cells along with the
                  highest colony-forming units (149.8 ± 11.6, p < 0.01) in
                  feeder-free conditions. Maximal HSPC fraction (CD34+ CD38-
                  CD45RA- CD49f+ CD90+) was 7.6-8.9\% after 10 days of
                  hematopoietic differentiation with 14.5\% adult β-globin
                  expression following RBC differentiation. Myeloid and
                  erythroid colonies were restricted strictly to the CD34+ CD43+
                  fraction (370.5 ± 65.7, p < 0.001), while the CD34- CD43+
                  fraction produced only a small number of colonies (21.6 ±
                  11.9). In addition, we differentiated the CD34+ CD43+ cells
                  towards T-lymphocytes using the OP9/DLL1 co-culture system
                  demonstrating double-positive T cells (CD4+ CD8+) with CD3+
                  expression displaying a broad T cell receptor (TCR)
                  repertoire. Confocal imaging of organoid-like structures
                  revealed a close association of CD31+ cells with CD34+ and
                  CD43+ cells, suggesting a potential emergence of HSPCs through
                  endothelial to hematopoietic transition. Furthermore,
                  fluorescently labeled organoids exhibited the emergence of
                  spherical non-attached cells from rare progenitors at the
                  border of the organoid center. CONCLUSIONS: In summary,
                  definitive HSPCs can be derived from ESCs through a dynamic
                  cellular process from an organoid-like structure, where
                  erythroid progeny are capable of producing adult hemoglobin
                  and lymphoid progeny shows a diverse TCR repertoire.},

                  anti-leukemic efficacy in combination with the DNMT-inhibitor,

                  selective sensitivity of mutant leukemia cells to VEN and AZA,
                  we used cell-based isogenic models containing a common
                  leukemia-associated mutation in the epigenetic regulator
                  ASXL1. KBM5 cells with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of the
                  ASXL1G710X mutation showed reduced leukemic growth, increased
                  myeloid differentiation, and decreased HOXA and BCL2 gene
                  expression in vitro compared to uncorrected KBM5 cells.
                  Increased expression of the anti-apoptotic gene, BCL2, was
                  also observed in bone marrow CD34+ cells from ASXL1 mutant MDS
                  patients compared to CD34+ cells from wild-type MDS cases.
                  ATAC-sequencing demonstrated open chromatin at the BCL2
                  promoter in the ASXL1 mutant KBM5 cells. BH3 profiling
                  demonstrated increased dependence of mutant cells on BCL2.
                  Upon treatment with VEN, mutant cells demonstrated increased
                  growth inhibition. In addition, genome-wide methylome analysis
                  of primary MDS samples and isogenic cell lines demonstrated
                  increased gene-body methylation in ASXL1 mutant cells, with
                  consequently increased sensitivity to AZA. These data
                  mechanistically link the common leukemia-associated mutation
                  ASXL1 to enhanced sensitivity to VEN and AZA via epigenetic

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous
                  disease with respect to presentation and clinical outcome. The
                  prognostic value of recently identified somatic mutations has
                  not been systematically evaluated in a phase 3 trial of
                  treatment for AML. METHODS: We performed a mutational analysis
                  of 18 genes in 398 patients younger than 60 years of age who
                  had AML and who were randomly assigned to receive induction
                  therapy with high-dose or standard-dose daunorubicin. We
                  validated our prognostic findings in an independent set of 104
                  patients. RESULTS: We identified at least one somatic
                  alteration in 97.3\% of the patients. We found that internal
                  tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), partial tandem
                  duplication in MLL (MLL-PTD), and mutations in ASXL1 and PHF6
                  were associated with reduced overall survival (P=0.001 for
                  FLT3-ITD, P=0.009 for MLL-PTD, P=0.05 for ASXL1, and P=0.006
                  for PHF6); CEBPA and IDH2 mutations were associated with
                  improved overall survival (P=0.05 for CEBPA and P=0.01 for
                  IDH2). The favorable effect of NPM1 mutations was restricted
                  to patients with co-occurring NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations.
                  We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved risk
                  stratification among patients with AML, independently of age,
                  white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy,
                  and validated the significance of these predictors in an
                  independent cohort. High-dose daunorubicin, as compared with
                  standard-dose daunorubicin, improved the rate of survival
                  among patients with DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL
                  translocations (P=0.001) but not among patients with wild-type
                  DNMT3A, NPM1, and MLL (P=0.67). CONCLUSIONS: We found that
                  DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations and MLL translocations predicted an
                  improved outcome with high-dose induction chemotherapy in
                  patients with AML. These findings suggest that mutational
                  profiling could potentially be used for risk stratification
                  and to inform prognostic and therapeutic decisions regarding
                  patients with AML. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute

                  this approach, implemented in our R toolkit Seurat
                  (http://satijalab.org/seurat/), to align scRNA-seq data sets

                  using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell
                  'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In each case,

                  regulatory sites in enhancers and promoters of eukaryotic
                  genes. How TFs locate their DNA targets and how multiple TFs
                  cooperate to regulate individual genes is still unclear. Most
                  yeast TFs are thought to regulate transcription via binding to
                  upstream activating sequences, situated within a few hundred
                  base pairs upstream of the regulated gene. While this model
                  has been validated for individual TFs and specific genes, it
                  has not been tested in a systematic way with the large set of
                  yeast TFs. Here, we have integrated information on the binding
                  and expression targets for the near-complete set of yeast TFs.
                  While we found many instances of functional TF binding sites
                  in upstream regulatory regions, we found many more instances
                  that do not fit this model. In many cases, rapid TF depletion
                  affects gene expression where there is no detectable binding
                  of that TF to the upstream region of the affected gene. In
                  addition, for most TFs, only a small fraction of bound TFs
                  regulates the nearby gene, showing that TF binding does not
                  automatically correspond to regulation of the linked gene.
                  Finally, we found that only a small percentage of TFs are
                  exclusively strong activators or repressors with most TFs
                  having dual function. Overall, our comprehensive mapping of TF
                  binding and regulatory targets have both confirmed known TF
                  relationships and revealed surprising properties of TF

                  years ago. Studies in the 1960s and 1970s demonstrated that B
                  and T lymphocytes were responsible primarily for the basic
                  functions of antibody production and cell-mediated immune
                  responses, respectively. The decades that followed have
                  witnessed a continuum of unfolding complexities in B-cell
                  development, subsets, and function that could not have been
                  predicted. Some of the landmark discoveries that led to our
                  current understanding of B lymphocytes as the source of
                  protective innate and adaptive antibodies are highlighted in

                  lymphoid and myeloid lineages as the earliest fate decision.
                  The validity of this model in the mouse has been questioned;
                  however, little is known about the lineage potential of human
                  progenitors. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the
                  human hematopoietic hierarchy by clonally mapping the
                  developmental potential of seven progenitor classes from
                  neonatal cord blood and adult bone marrow. Human multilymphoid
                  progenitors, identified as a distinct population of
                  Thy-1(neg-lo)CD45RA(+) cells in the CD34(+)CD38(-) stem cell
                  compartment, gave rise to all lymphoid cell types, as well as
                  monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, which indicated
                  that these myeloid lineages arise in early lymphoid lineage
                  specification. Thus, as in the mouse, human hematopoiesis does
                  not follow a rigid model of myeloid-lymphoid segregation.},

                  differentiation as terminally differentiated cells express
                  tissue-specific genes, but their DNA sequence is unchanged.
                  Haematopoiesis provides a well-defined model to study
                  epigenetic modifications during cell-fate decisions, as
                  multipotent progenitors (MPPs) differentiate into
                  progressively restricted myeloid or lymphoid progenitors.
                  Although DNA methylation is critical for myeloid versus
                  lymphoid differentiation, as demonstrated by the
                  myeloerythroid bias in Dnmt1 hypomorphs, a comprehensive DNA
                  methylation map of haematopoietic progenitors, or of any
                  multipotent/oligopotent lineage, does not exist. Here we
                  examined 4.6 million CpG sites throughout the genome for MPPs,
                  common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), common myeloid progenitors
                  (CMPs), granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and
                  thymocyte progenitors (DN1, DN2, DN3). Marked epigenetic
                  plasticity accompanied both lymphoid and myeloid restriction.
                  Myeloid commitment involved less global DNA methylation than
                  lymphoid commitment, supported functionally by myeloid skewing
                  of progenitors following treatment with a DNA
                  methyltransferase inhibitor. Differential DNA methylation
                  correlated with gene expression more strongly at CpG island
                  shores than CpG islands. Many examples of genes and pathways
                  not previously known to be involved in choice between
                  lymphoid/myeloid differentiation have been identified, such as
                  Arl4c and Jdp2. Several transcription factors, including
                  Meis1, were methylated and silenced during differentiation,
                  indicating a role in maintaining an undifferentiated state.
                  Additionally, epigenetic modification of modifiers of the
                  epigenome seems to be important in haematopoietic
                  differentiation. Our results directly demonstrate that
                  modulation of DNA methylation occurs during lineage-specific
                  differentiation and defines a comprehensive map of the
                  methylation and transcriptional changes that accompany myeloid
                  versus lymphoid fate decisions.},

                  type differentiation from early gastrulation to the end of
                  segmentation. In the absence of cell division, differentiation

                  leukemic DNA methylation patterning is primarily driven by
                  nonpromoter regulatory elements and CpG shores. Enhancers
                  displayed stronger differential methylation than promoters,
                  consisting predominantly of hypomethylation. AMLs with
                  dominant hypermethylation featured greater epigenetic
                  disruption of promoters, whereas those with dominant
                  hypomethylation displayed greater disruption of distal and
                  intronic regions. Mutations in IDH and DNMT3A had opposing and
                  mutually exclusive effects on the epigenome. Notably,
                  co-occurrence of both mutations resulted in epigenetic
                  antagonism, with most CpGs affected by either mutation alone
                  no longer affected in double-mutant AMLs. Importantly, this

                  AML is biologically heterogeneous with subtypes characterized
                  by specific genetic and epigenetic abnormalities.
                  Comprehensive DNA methylation profiling revealed that
                  differential methylation of nonpromoter regulatory elements is
                  a driver of epigenetic identity, that gene mutations can be
                  context-dependent, and that co-occurrence of mutations in
                  epigenetic modifiers can result in epigenetic antagonism.

                  on human hematopoiesis has advanced significantly in recent
                  years, yet the full ramifications of these findings are not
                  fully understood. This review summarizes these findings and
                  discusses their implication as they relate to malignant
                  hematopoiesis. RECENT FINDINGS: With human aging there is an
                  impaired immune response, loss of hematopoietic stem cell
                  (HSC) function, increase in clonal hematopoiesis, and higher
                  frequency of myeloid malignancies. Although murine models have
                  implicated abnormalities in DNA damage repair, autophagy,
                  metabolism, and epigenetics, studies in primary human
                  specimens are more limited. The development of age-related
                  clonal hematopoiesis and the risk associated with this is one
                  of the major findings in the field of recent years. This is
                  accompanied by changes in bone marrow stem and progenitor
                  composition, changes in the epigenetic program of stem cells
                  and an inflammatory milieu in the bone marrow. The precise
                  consequences of these changes for the development of
                  age-related malignancies are still unclear. SUMMARY: Advances
                  in the field have begun to reveal the mechanisms driving human
                  HSC loss of function with age. It will be critical to
                  delineate between normal and malignant aging in order to
                  better prevent age-associated myeloid malignancies.},

                  remains unclear whether the cell of origin influences the
                  biology of the resultant leukemia. MLL-AF9-transduced single
                  HSCs or GMPs could be continuously replated, but HSC-derived
                  clones were more likely than GMP-derived clones to initiate
                  AML in mice. Leukemia stem cells derived from either HSCs or
                  GMPs had a similar immunophenotype consistent with a maturing
                  myeloid cell (LGMP). Gene expression analyses demonstrated
                  that LGMP inherited gene expression programs from the cell of
                  origin including high-level Evi-1 expression in HSC-derived

                  progenitor cell (HSPC) malignancies characterized by
                  ineffective hematopoiesis and an increased risk of leukemia
                  transformation. Epigenetic regulators are recurrently mutated
                  in MDS, directly implicating epigenetic dysregulation in MDS
                  pathogenesis. Here, we identified a tumor suppressor role of
                  the acetyltransferase p300 in clinically relevant MDS models
                  driven by mutations in the epigenetic regulators TET2, ASXL1,
                  and SRSF2. The loss of p300 enhanced the proliferation and
                  self-renewal capacity of Tet2-deficient HSPCs, resulting in an
                  increased HSPC pool and leukemogenicity in primary and
                  transplantation mouse models. Mechanistically, the loss of
                  p300 in Tet2-deficient HSPCs altered enhancer accessibility
                  and the expression of genes associated with differentiation,
                  proliferation, and leukemia development. Particularly, p300
                  loss led to an increased expression of Myb, and the depletion
                  of Myb attenuated the proliferation of HSPCs and improved the
                  survival of leukemia-bearing mice. Additionally, we show that
                  chemical inhibition of p300 acetyltransferase activity
                  phenocopied Ep300 deletion in Tet2-deficient HSPCs, whereas
                  activation of p300 activity with a small molecule impaired the
                  self-renewal and leukemogenicity of Tet2-deficient cells. This
                  suggests a potential therapeutic application of p300

                  study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
                  from AML patient samples harboring MLL rearrangements and
                  found that they retained leukemic mutations but reset leukemic
                  DNA methylation/gene expression patterns. AML-iPSCs lacked
                  leukemic potential, but when differentiated into hematopoietic

                  hypermethylation at intronic enhancers in the dicentric
                  subgroup, in which low expression levels of enhancer putative
                  target genes accounted for around 35\% of the downregulated
                  signature. Enrichment of Krüppel-like transcription factor
                  binding sites emerged at enhancers. Furthermore, a specific
                  hypermethylated pattern on 1q was found to underlie the
                  hypo-expression of more than 50\% of 1q-deregulated genes,
                  despite trisomy. In summary, dic(1;7) in MDS establishes a

                  leukemia in adults, leading to the highest number of annual
                  leukemia-associated deaths in the USA. Although most AML
                  patients initially enter remission following induction
                  therapy, most eventually relapse, underscoring the unmet need
                  for more effective therapies. In recent years, novel

                  models of disease have increased our understanding of the
                  molecular mechanisms that lead to AML. Leukemogenic mechanisms
                  can be broadly classified into two types-cell-intrinsic and
                  cell-extrinsic. Cell-intrinsic mechanisms include an array of
                  genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to dysregulated
                  gene expression and function in hematopoietic stem/progenitor
                  cells, leading to their increased fitness and ultimately,
                  malignant transformation. Extrinsic mechanisms include both
                  hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic stromal components of the
                  leukemic microenvironment that interact with pre-leukemic and
                  leukemic clones to promote their survival, self-renewal,
                  and/or resistance to therapy. Through the individual and
                  concerted action of these factors, pre-leukemic clones acquire
                  the changes necessary for leukemic transformation. In
                  addition, following therapy, specific leukemic clones are
                  selected for that eventually re-initiate disease. Improving

                  hemopoietic stem cells and committed myeloid progenitors
                  without affecting their rate of proliferation.
                  BAF45a-deficient hemopoietic stem cells and myeloid
                  progenitors are selectively lost from mixed bone marrow
                  chimeras, indicating their impaired function even in an intact
                  microenvironment. Together, these studies suggest that the
                  BAF45a subunit of SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling complexes
                  plays nonredundant and specialized roles within the developing

                  fusion proteins containing the MyoD1 sequence show that MyoD1

                  domains of the MyoD1 protein were analyzed by site-directed
                  deletional mutagenesis of the MyoD1 cDNA. Deletion of a highly
                  basic region (residues 102 to 135) interferes with both
                  nuclear localization and induction of myogenesis. Deletion of
                  a short region (residues 143 to 162) that is similar to a
                  conserved region in the c-Myc family of proteins eliminates
                  the ability of the MyoD1 protein to initiate myogenesis but

                  expression of only 68 amino acids of MyoD1, containing the
                  basic and the Myc similarity domains, is sufficient to
                  activate myogenesis in stably transfected 10T1/2 cells.

                  differentiation, immune response, and disease progression.
                  While examining cells along a computationally ordered
                  pseudotime offers the potential to study how subtle changes in
                  gene or protein expression impact cell fate decision-making,
                  identifying characteristic features that drive continuous
                  biological processes remains difficult to detect from
                  unenriched and noisy single-cell data. Given that all profiled
                  sources of feature variation contribute to the cell-to-cell
                  distances that define an inferred cellular trajectory,
                  including confounding sources of biological variation (e.g.
                  cell cycle or metabolic state) or noisy and irrelevant
                  features (e.g. measurements with low signal-to-noise ratio)
                  can mask the underlying trajectory of study and hinder
                  inference. Here, we present DELVE (dynamic selection of
                  locally covarying features), an unsupervised feature selection
                  method for identifying a representative subset of
                  dynamically-expressed molecular features that recapitulates
                  cellular trajectories. In contrast to previous work, DELVE
                  uses a bottom-up approach to mitigate the effect of unwanted
                  sources of variation confounding inference, and instead models
                  cell states from dynamic feature modules that constitute core
                  regulatory complexes. Using simulations, single-cell RNA
                  sequencing data, and iterative immunofluorescence imaging data
                  in the context of the cell cycle and cellular differentiation,
                  we demonstrate that DELVE selects features that more
                  accurately characterize cell populations and improve the

                  RNA-sequencing datasets. However, trajectories with
                  complicated topologies such as loops, disparate lineages and
                  bifurcating hierarchy remain difficult to infer accurately.
                  Here, we introduce a density-based trajectory inference method
                  capable of constructing diverse shapes of topological patterns
                  including the most intriguing bifurcations. The novelty of our
                  method is a step to exploit overlapping probability
                  distributions to identify transition states of cells for
                  determining connectability between cell clusters, and another
                  step to infer a stable trajectory through a base-topology
                  guided iterative fitting. Our method precisely re-constructed

                  of genetic screening with single-cell transcriptomics readout.
                  To overcome these limitations, we introduce targeted
                  Perturb-seq (TAP-seq), a sensitive, inexpensive and
                  platform-independent method focusing single-cell RNA-seq

                  detects weak effects and lowly expressed genes, and decreases

                  popularity in cellular differentiation studies regarding their
                  ability to resolve potential heterogeneities in cell
                  populations. Analyzing such high-dimensional single-cell data
                  has its own statistical and computational challenges. Popular
                  multivariate approaches are based on data normalization,
                  followed by dimension reduction and clustering to identify
                  subgroups. However, in the case of cellular differentiation,
                  we would not expect clear clusters to be present but instead
                  expect the cells to follow continuous branching lineages.
                  RESULTS: Here, we propose the use of diffusion maps to deal
                  with the problem of defining differentiation trajectories. We
                  adapt this method to single-cell data by adequate choice of
                  kernel width and inclusion of uncertainties or missing
                  measurement values, which enables the establishment of a
                  pseudotemporal ordering of single cells in a high-dimensional
                  gene expression space. We expect this output to reflect cell
                  differentiation trajectories, where the data originates from
                  intrinsic diffusion-like dynamics. Starting from a pluripotent
                  stage, cells move smoothly within the transcriptional
                  landscape towards more differentiated states with some
                  stochasticity along their path. We demonstrate the robustness
                  of our method with respect to extrinsic noise (e.g.
                  measurement noise) and sampling density heterogeneities on
                  simulated toy data as well as two single-cell quantitative
                  polymerase chain reaction datasets (i.e. mouse haematopoietic
                  stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells) and an RNA-Seq data
                  of human pre-implantation embryos. We show that diffusion maps
                  perform considerably better than Principal Component Analysis
                  and are advantageous over other techniques for non-linear
                  dimension reduction such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour
                  Embedding for preserving the global structures and
                  pseudotemporal ordering of cells. AVAILABILITY AND

                  morphological and transmitter/receptor classifications. The
                  RNA from defined single cells is amplified by microinjecting
                  primer, nucleotides, and enzyme into acutely dissociated cells
                  from a defined region of rat brain. Further processing yields
                  amplified antisense RNA. A second round of amplification
                  results in greater than 10(6)-fold amplification of the
                  original starting material, which is adequate for
                  analysis--e.g., use as a probe, making of cDNA libraries, etc.
                  We demonstrate this method by constructing expression profiles
                  of single live cells from rat hippocampus. This profiling
                  suggests that cells that appear to be morphologically similar
                  may show marked differences in patterns of expression. In
                  addition, we characterize several mRNAs from a single cell,
                  some of which were previously undescribed, perhaps due to
                  "rarity" when averaged over many cell types.
                  Electrophysiological analysis coupled with molecular biology

                  single-cell RNA-seq readout into a mouse model of
                  Kras;Trp53(KP)-driven lung adenocarcinoma and tracked tumor
                  evolution from single-transformed cells to metastatic tumors
                  at unprecedented resolution. We found that the loss of the
                  initial, stable alveolar-type2-like state was accompanied by a
                  transient increase in plasticity. This was followed by the
                  adoption of distinct transcriptional programs that enable
                  rapid expansion and, ultimately, clonal sweep of stable
                  subclones capable of metastasizing. Finally, tumors develop
                  through stereotypical evolutionary trajectories, and
                  perturbing additional tumor suppressors accelerates
                  progression by creating novel trajectories. Our study
                  elucidates the hierarchical nature of tumor evolution and,
                  more broadly, enables in-depth studies of tumor progression.},

                  treatment of human degenerative disease. Because ES cells are
                  pluripotent, they can be directed to differentiate into a
                  number of alternative cell-types with potential therapeutic
                  value. Such attempts at "rationally-directed ES cell
                  differentiation" constitute attempts to recapitulate aspects
                  of normal development in vitro. All differentiated cells
                  retain identical DNA content, yet gene expression varies
                  widely from cell-type to cell-type. Therefore, a potent
                  epigenetic system has evolved to coordinate and maintain
                  tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. Recent advances
                  show that mechanisms that govern epigenetic regulation of gene
                  expression are rooted in the details of chromatin dynamics. As
                  embryonic cells differentiate, certain genes are activated
                  while others are silenced. These activation and silencing
                  events are exquisitely coordinated with the allocation of cell
                  lineages. Remodeling of the chromatin of
                  developmentally-regulated genes occurs in conjunction with
                  lineage commitment. Oocytes, early embryos, and ES cells
                  contain potent chromatin-remodeling activities, an observation
                  that suggests that chromatin dynamics may be especially
                  important for early lineage decisions. Chromatin dynamics are
                  also involved in the differentiation of adult stem cells,
                  where the assembly of specialized chromatin upon
                  tissue-specific genes has been studied in fine detail. The
                  next few years will likely yield striking advances in the
                  understanding of stem cell differentiation and developmental
                  biology from the perspective of chromatin dynamics.},

                  metazoan growth and development. A strict coordination between
                  genetic and epigenetic programs regulates cell fate
                  determination and maintenance. Polycomb group (PcG) genes are
                  identified as essential in these epigenetic developmental
                  processes. These genes encode components of multimeric
                  transcriptional repressor complexes that are crucial in
                  maintaining cell fate. PcG proteins have also been shown to
                  play a central role in stem cell maintenance and lineage
                  specification. PcG proteins, together with a battery of
                  components including sequence-specific DNA binding/accessory
                  factors, chromatin remodeling factors, signaling pathway
                  intermediates, noncoding small RNAs, and RNA interference
                  machinery, generally define a dynamic cellular identity
                  through tight regulation of specific gene expression patterns.
                  Epigenetic modification of chromatin structure that results in
                  expression silencing of specific genes is now emerging as an
                  important molecular mechanism in this process. In embryonic
                  stem (ES) cells and adult stem cells, such specific genes
                  represent those associated with differentiation and
                  development, and silencing of these genes in a PcG
                  protein-dependent manner confers stemness. ES cells also
                  contain novel chromatin motifs enriched in epigenetic
                  modifications associated with both activation and repression
                  of genes, suggesting that certain genes are poised for
                  activation or repression. Interestingly, these chromatin
                  domains are highly coincident with the promoters of
                  developmental regulators, which are also found to be occupied
                  by PcG proteins. The epigenetic integrity is compromised,
                  however, by mutations or other alterations that affect the
                  function of PcG proteins in stem cells leading to aberrant
                  cell proliferation and tissue transformation, a hallmark of
                  cancer. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found

                  our knowledge about several diseases. Coupled with easy
                  accessibility to blood samples, hematology plays a leading
                  role in understanding the process of carcinogenesis. Clonal
                  hematopoiesis (CH) with somatic mutations is observed in at
                  least 10\% of people over 65 years of age, without apparent
                  hematologic disorders. CH is associated with increased risk of
                  hematologic malignancies, which is indicative of a
                  pre-malignant condition. Therefore, a better understanding of
                  CH will help elucidate the mechanism of multi-step
                  tumorigenesis in the hematopoietic system. Somatic mutations
                  of ASXL1 are frequently detected in CH and myeloid
                  malignancies. Although ASXL1 does not have any catalytic
                  activity, it is involved in multiple histone modifications
                  including H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H2AK119Ub, suggesting its
                  function as a scaffolding protein. Most ASXL1 mutations
                  detected in CH and myeloid malignancies are frameshift or
                  nonsense mutations of the last exon, generating a C-terminally
                  truncated protein. Deletion of Asxl1 or expression of mutant
                  ASXL1 in mice alters histone modifications and facilitates
                  aberrant gene expression, resulting in myeloid transformation.
                  On the contrary, these mice exhibit impaired functioning of
                  hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), suggesting the negative
                  effects of ASXL1 mutations on stem cell function. Thus, how
                  ASXL1 mutations induce a clonal advantage of hematopoietic
                  cells and subsequent CH development has not been elucidated.
                  Here, we have reviewed the current literature that enhances
                  our understanding of ASXL1, including its mutational
                  landscape, function, and involvement of its mutation in
                  pathogenesis of CH and myeloid malignancies. Finally, we
                  discuss the potential causes of CH harboring ASXL1 mutations

                  haematopoiesis, a summary of which was attempted in this
                  review. Interestingly, MLL-rearranged leukaemias are
                  particularly prominent in infant and paediatric leukaemia,
                  which commonly initiate in utero. This, together with the
                  known function of MLL/SET proteins in embryonic development,
                  has focussed research efforts in recent years on understanding
                  the role of this protein family in developmental
                  haematopoiesis and how this may be subverted by MLL
                  oncofusions in infant leukaemia. A detailed understanding of
                  these prenatal events is essential for the development of new
                  treatments that improve the survival specifically of this very
                  young patient group.},

                  escape from signaling via the interleukin 7 receptor (IL-7R).
                  By activating the transcription factor STAT5, IL-7R signaling
                  maintains proliferation and represses Igk germline
                  transcription by unknown mechanisms. We demonstrate that a
                  STAT5 tetramer bound the Igk intronic enhancer (E(κi)), which
                  led to recruitment of the histone methyltransferase Ezh2. Ezh2
                  marked trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys27 (H3K27me3)
                  throughout the κ-chain joining region (J(κ)) to the κ-chain
                  constant region (C(κ)). In the absence of Ezh2, IL-7 failed to
                  repress Igk germline transcription. H3K27me3 modifications
                  were lost after termination of IL-7R-STAT5 signaling, and the

                  developed to remove unwanted technical or biological
                  variations and integrate heterogeneous single-cell datasets.
                  Despite their wide usage, existing methods suffer from several
                  fundamental limitations. In particular, we lack a rigorous
                  statistical test for whether two high-dimensional single-cell
                  datasets are alignable (and therefore should even be aligned).
                  Moreover, popular methods can substantially distort the data
                  during alignment, making the aligned data and downstream
                  analysis difficult to interpret. To overcome these
                  limitations, we present a spectral manifold alignment and
                  inference (SMAI) framework, which enables principled and
                  interpretable alignability testing and structure-preserving
                  integration of single-cell data. SMAI provides a statistical
                  test to robustly determine the alignability between datasets
                  to avoid misleading inference, and is justified by
                  high-dimensional statistical theory. On a diverse range of
                  real and simulated benchmark datasets, it outperforms commonly
                  used alignment methods. Moreover, we show that SMAI improves
                  various downstream analyses such as identification of
                  differentially expressed genes and imputation of single-cell
                  spatial transcriptomics, providing further biological
                  insights. SMAI’s interpretability also enables quantification
                  and a deeper understanding of the sources of technical
                  confounders in single-cell data. \#\#\# Competing Interest

                  diversity and aid in the development of personalized therapies
                  for individuals. The abundance of missing values, known as
                  dropouts, makes the analysis of scRNA-seq data a challenging
                  task. Most traditional methods made assumptions about specific
                  distributions for missing values, which limit their capability
                  to capture the intricacy of high-dimensional scRNA-seq data.
                  Moreover, the imputation performance of traditional methods
                  decreases with higher missing rates. We propose a novel f
                  -divergence based generative adversarial imputation method,
                  called sc- f GAIN, for the scRNA-seq data imputation. Our
                  studies identify four f -divergence functions, namely
                  cross-entropy, Kullback-Leibler (KL), reverse KL, and
                  Jensen-Shannon, that can be effectively integrated with the
                  generative adversarial imputation network to generate imputed
                  values without any assumptions, and mathematically prove that
                  the distribution of imputed data using sc- f GAIN algorithm is
                  same as the distribution of original data. Real scRNA-seq data
                  analysis has shown that, compared to many traditional methods,
                  the imputed values generated by sc- f GAIN algorithm have a
                  smaller root-mean-square error, and it is robust to varying
                  missing rates, moreover, it can reduce imputation bias. The
                  flexibility offered by the f -divergence allows the sc- f GAIN
                  method to accommodate various types of data, making it a more
                  universal approach for imputing missing values of scRNA-seq

                  extending from inferring trajectories from snapshots of
                  cellular states to estimating temporal changes in cellular

                  tracking over time. We then show that by using metabolic

                  constitutively dividing cells, RNAForecaster accurately
                  recapitulates many of the expected changes in gene expression
                  during progression through the cell cycle over a 3-day period.
                  Thus, RNAForecaster enables short-term estimation of future

                  loss-of-function (LOF) or, in stark contrast, may enhance
                  function or even lead to novel characteristics of a particular
                  gene, termed gain-of-function (GOF). In contrast to LOF
                  mutations, GOF mutations almost exclusively occur in a
                  heterozygous fashion. Current genome-editing protocols do not
                  allow for the selective targeting of individual alleles,
                  hampering the ability to model heterozygous GOF mutations.
                  Here, we provide a detailed protocol on how to engineer
                  heterozygous GOF hotspot mutations in human HSPCs by combining
                  CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair and recombinant
                  AAV6 technology for efficient DNA donor template transfer.
                  Importantly, this strategy makes use of a dual fluorescent
                  reporter system to allow for the tracking and purification of
                  successfully heterozygously edited HSPCs. This strategy can be
                  employed to precisely investigate how GOF mutations affect
                  HSPC function and their progression toward hematological
                  malignancies.},

                  many novel mutations in a variety of genes in patients with
                  myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Most of these mutations are
                  thought to be loss-of-function mutations, with some
                  exceptions, such as the gain-of-function IDH1/2 and SRSF2
                  mutations. Among the mutations, ASXL1 mutations attract much
                  attention; the ASXL1 mutations are identified in a variety of
                  hematologic malignancies and always predicts poor prognosis.
                  It was found that the C-terminal truncating mutants of the
                  ASXL1 or ASXL1 deletion induced MDS-like diseases in mouse. In
                  addition, it has recently been reported that ASXL1 mutations
                  are frequently found in clonal hematopoiesis in healthy
                  elderly people, who frequently progress to hematologic
                  malignancies. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by
                  which ASXL1 mutations induce hematologic malignancies are not
                  fully understood. Moreover, whether ASXL1 mutations are
                  loss-of-function mutations or dominant-negative or
                  gain-of-function mutations remains a matter of controversy. We
                  here present solid evidence indicating that the C-terminal
                  truncating ASXL1 protein is indeed expressed in cells
                  harboring homozygous mutations of ASXL1, indicating the ASXL1
                  mutations are dominant-negative or gain-of-function mutations;
                  for the first time, we detected the truncated ASXL1 proteins
                  in two cell lines lacking the intact ASXL1 gene by mass
                  spectrometry and Western blot analyses. Thus, together with
                  our previous results, the present results indicate that the
                  truncating ASXL1 mutant is indeed expressed in MDS cells and
                  may play a role in MDS pathogenesis not previously considered.},

                  hyperactive ASXL1-BAP1 complexes in a haematopoietic precursor

                  (ASXL1) frequently occur in patients with myeloid malignancies

                  global loss of Asxl1 leads to the development of myeloid
                  malignancies and impairs bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) fates
                  in mice. However, the impact of Asxl1 deletion in the BM niche
                  on hematopoiesis remains unclear. Here, we showed that BMSCs
                  derived from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients had
                  reduced expression of ASXL1, which impaired the maintaining
                  cord blood CD34+ cell colony-forming capacity with a myeloid
                  differentiation bias. Furthermore, Asxl1 deletion in the mouse
                  BMSCs altered hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSC/HPC)
                  pool and a preferential myeloid lineage increment.
                  Immunoprecipitation and ChIP-seq analyses demonstrated a novel

                  ChIP-seq data revealed that loss of Asxl1 deregulated RNAPII
                  transcriptional function and altered the expression of genes
                  critical for HSC/HPC maintenance, such as Vcam1. Altogether,

                  alteration in, at least, a subset of the niche cells induces
                  myeloid differentiation bias, thus, contributes the

                  cholangiocytes, respectively, and this provides a practical

                  events associated with major morphological transitions in
                  vertebrates have remained elusive. We identified
                  snake-specific sequence changes within an otherwise highly
                  conserved long-range limb enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh).
                  Transgenic mouse reporter assays revealed that the in vivo
                  activity pattern of the enhancer is conserved across a wide
                  range of vertebrates, including fish, but not in snakes.
                  Genomic substitution of the mouse enhancer with its human or
                  fish ortholog results in normal limb development. In contrast,
                  replacement with snake orthologs caused severe limb reduction.

                  10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human

                  to obtain mechanistic insights into development and cell
                  differentiation (Kretzschmar and Watt, 2012). Over a century
                  ago, cells and their progeny were tracked using simple dye
                  labelling experiments. Following the same principle, powerful
                  contemporary approaches label cells with unique heritable
                  molecular barcodes, using single-cell RNA-sequencing to read
                  out cell lineage and gene expression in parallel, in many
                  individual cells. Here, we highlight several preprints in this
                  fast-moving area of single-cell genomics-based lineage
                  tracing.Early single-cell genomics methods to measure lineage
                  relied on CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing or virus-based
                  methods to introduce unique genetic barcodes into cells.
                  However, these early methods are limited by technical
                  barriers, such as the deletion of CRISPR-Cas9 lineage records
                  or the use of non-mutable virus-based labelling, restricting
                  the resolution of lineage tree construction (Kester and van
                  Oudenaarden, 2018; VanHorn and Morris, 2021). Recent
                  lineage-tracing methods have therefore adopted an ensemble
                  approach to overcome some of these limitations, e.g. to record
                  lineages in human cerebral organoids (He et al., 2021). Two
                  recent preprints take an entirely unique approach, using DNA
                  recording devices to store information relating to lineage and
                  the past states of cells, reading this information later in
                  time. Both methods use prime editing – a gene-editing method
                  employing DNA mismatch repair to precisely introduce targeted
                  small insertions, deletions and base swapping. Using this
                  method, cells are uniquely labelled over time to enable
                  lineage relationships to be resolved.In the first of these two
                  preprints, Choi et al. introduce a new method termed ‘DNA
                  Ticker Tape’, a tandem array of partial CRISPR/Cas9 target
                  sites designed to be targeted by Cas9 in an ordered manner by
                  leveraging insertion events created via prime editing (Choi et
                  al., 2021 preprint). Each successive edit records the identity
                  of the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) that mediated the edit
                  while also shifting the position of the active target site by
                  one unit along the array, resulting in sequential genome
                  editing. Via constitutive pegRNA expression, the authors use
                  this information encoder to record lineage relationships
                  between cells. Furthermore, in proof-of-principle experiments,
                  they demonstrate how signals of interest can be coupled to the
                  expression or activity of a pegRNA, allowing the precise order
                  of molecular events within individual cells to be
                  recorded.Appearing in tandem with DNA Ticker Tape, peCHYRON
                  (prime editing Cell HistorY Recording by Ordered iNsertion) is
                  a DNA recorder technology that leverages prime editing to
                  record sequential signals into one genomic locus over time
                  (Loveless et al., 2021 preprint). Using a prime editor enzyme
                  and pegRNAs barcoded with unique 3 bp sequences, unique
                  cellular barcodes are generated over time by assembling
                  combinations of these 3 bp sequences. Using an alternating
                  insertion sequence, prime editing can be propagated for many
                  rounds to record both lineage and molecular events. Both DNA
                  Ticker Tape and peCHYRON represent exciting additions to the
                  field, allowing the precise order of molecular events to be
                  tracked. For example, they allow information about the order
                  in which a cell receives a series of signals to be integrated
                  with lineage information, enabling deeper mechanistic insight
                  across a range of biological questions.Although genomic
                  methods continue to be at the forefront of lineage-tracing
                  innovations, their combination with spatial and imaging data
                  is still limited by the inaccessibility of high-resolution
                  spatial genomics methods. Unsurprisingly, researchers are
                  continuing to develop fluorescent protein-based
                  lineage-tracing approaches, with a focus on improving clonal
                  resolution and usability. For example, Caviglia, Unterweger et
                  al. developed FRaeppli, a Cre-inducible PhiC31-based
                  multicolour labelling approach that can be used in zebrafish
                  with almost perfect colour distribution (∼25\% for each of the
                  four cassettes). In addition, the FRaeppli cassette does not
                  contain any fluorescent proteins in the green spectrum, which
                  allows its combination with classic EGFP transgenic lines
                  (Caviglia et al., 2022 preprint). An alternative to genetic
                  lineage tracing, albeit for shorter chase times, is
                  photoconversion of fluorescent proteins, which allows
                  researchers to selectively label cells of interest during
                  imaging experiments. A recent study used photoconversion to
                  label motile versus non-motile epithelial cells during airway
                  regeneration, allowing these cells to be profiled separately
                  by single-cell sequencing and thereby uncovering potential
                  regulatory mechanisms (Kwok et al., 2022 preprint). Another
                  study exploited the power of correlative live and fixed
                  microscopy to delineate fate decisions in cerebral organoids
                  (Coquand et al., 2022 preprint). In this case, the authors
                  used sparse lentiviral transduction and GFP live imaging to
                  define clonal dynamic behaviours of neural progenitors; they
                  then performed correlative fixation and immunostaining to
                  evaluate the fates of each cell within unique clones,
                  characterizing their variation in morphology, self-renewal,
                  differentiation and fates. Thus, far from being outdated,
                  imaging-based tracing technologies continue to see a steady
                  upgrade in capabilities and analytic power.In parallel with
                  these methodological developments, the array of biological
                  questions that are being examined through the combination of
                  single-cell profiling and lineage tracing is expanding. One of
                  the most exciting questions that lineage tracing seems
                  uniquely suited to address is how cell dedifferentiation
                  contributes to tissue regeneration. A recent study
                  interrogated the progeny of Tbx5+ cardiomyocytes during heart
                  regeneration, uncovering a variety of Tbx5-derived cell states
                  that could potentially be used to improve induced pluripotent
                  stem cell (iPSC)-derived heart cell therapies (Siatra et al.,
                  2022 preprint). Another study profiled the progeny of stromal
                  cells during endometrial regeneration, confirming their
                  contribution to the epithelial layer after each menstrual
                  cycle (Kirkwood et al., 2022 preprint).Clonal tracking and
                  single-cell profiling also continue to shed light on our
                  understanding of cellular memories during differentiation. In
                  an exciting new study, Mold et al. analysed a wide array of
                  datasets from cell-tracing experiments and revealed vast
                  transcriptional variation among different clones of neurons
                  and T lymphocytes (Mold et al., 2022 preprint). This extends
                  previous observations about transcriptional heritability in
                  stem cells and cancer cells into exciting new territories. The
                  authors also showed that chromatin accessibility differences
                  correlate with clonal transcriptional heritability, although
                  the mechanistic underpinning of clonal variation remains
                  unclear.Finally, the ever-increasing complexity of single-cell
                  lineage tracing studies must be accompanied by computational
                  methods to construct single-cell phylogenies and interpret the
                  resulting data. Initially, approaches based on maximum
                  parsimony were developed, but these methods had to dispense
                  with some lineage information, reducing the accuracy of tree
                  reconstruction. However, several recent studies report
                  computational methods designed to overcome these limitations.
                  For example, TiDeTree (Time-scaled Developmental Trees) is a
                  Bayesian phylogenetic framework that uses genetic lineage
                  tracing data to infer time-scaled single-cell phylogenies and
                  population dynamics such as cell division, death and
                  differentiation rates (Seidel and Stadler, 2022 preprint).
                  Such methods are also being accompanied by modelling
                  approaches to test the feasibility of phylogeny inference from
                  CRISPR-Cas9 cell labelling approaches (Wang et al., 2021
                  preprint), which will undoubtedly aid experimental method
                  development. Finally, with lineage information to hand,
                  methods to aid biological interpretation are emerging. For
                  example, ClonoCluster (Richman et al., 2022 preprint) is a
                  computational method that combines both clone and
                  transcriptomic information to reveal biologically relevant
                  expression differences between cells that relate to functional
                  outcomes. As additional modalities, such as chromatin
                  accessibility and epigenetic information, are captured in
                  parallel with lineage information, computational methods such
                  as ClonoCluster represent valuable platforms with which to
                  build upon to extract useful biological information from the
                  complex datasets generated.Single-cell lineage tracing is
                  evolving at a fast pace. The continued development of
                  experimental and computational methods to construct lineages,
                  together with the application of these approaches, promises
                  unprecedented mechanistic insight into an array of
                  longstanding biological questions.A.R.F. acknowledges helpful

                  within complex tissues and are likely to unlock our
                  understanding of various mechanisms involved in development or
                  diseases. Running scHTPM experiments and analyzing the data
                  produced remains challenging since few consensus guidelines
                  currently exist regarding good practices for experimental
                  design and data analysis pipelines. RESULTS: We perform a
                  computational benchmark to assess the impact of experimental
                  parameters and data analysis pipelines on the ability of the
                  cell representation to recapitulate known biological
                  similarities. We run more than ten thousand experiments to
                  systematically study the impact of coverage and number of
                  cells, of the count matrix construction method, of feature
                  selection and normalization, and of the dimension reduction
                  algorithm used. This allows us to identify key experimental
                  parameters and computational choices to obtain a good
                  representation of single-cell HPTM data. We show in particular
                  that the count matrix construction step has a strong influence
                  on the quality of the representation and that using fixed-size
                  bin counts outperforms annotation-based binning. Dimension
                  reduction methods based on latent semantic indexing outperform
                  others, and feature selection is detrimental, while keeping
                  only high-quality cells has little influence on the final
                  representation as long as enough cells are analyzed.
                  CONCLUSIONS: This benchmark provides a comprehensive study on
                  how experimental parameters and computational choices affect

                  extensively studied in mice and other preclinical models, but
                  technical challenges have precluded a commensurate exploration
                  in humans. Institutional pathology archives contain thousands
                  of paraffinized bone marrow core biopsy tissue specimens,
                  providing a rich resource for studying the intact human bone
                  marrow topography in a variety of physiologic states. Thus, we
                  developed an end-to-end pipeline involving multiparameter
                  whole tissue staining, in situ imaging at single-cell

                  content and proportions of early myeloid and erythroid

                  suggest that there is topographic remodeling of human
                  hematopoiesis associated with aging. More generally, we
                  demonstrate the potential to deeply unravel the spatial

                  We asked whether long-term, heritable differences in

                  Studying clonal human lymphocytes and mouse brain cells, we

                  bone marrow which is characterized by the clonal expansion and

                  age-adjusted incidence of AML is 4.3 per 100,000 annually in
                  the United States (US). Incidence increases with age with a
                  median age at diagnosis of 68 years in the US. The etiology of
                  AML is heterogeneous. In some patients, prior exposure to
                  therapeutic, occupational or environmental DNA-damaging agents
                  is implicated, but most cases of AML remain without a clear
                  etiology. AML is the most common form of acute leukemia in
                  adults and has the shortest survival (5-year survival = 24\%).
                  Curative therapies, including intensive chemotherapy and

                  the management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: The
                  authors identified 29,107 patients who were diagnosed with de
                  novo AML between 1980 and 2017 in the National Cancer
                  Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
                  database. Patients were categorized into 5 age groups (ages
                  birth to 14, 15-39, 40-59, 60-69, and ≥70 years) and 4
                  calendar periods (1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, and
                  2010-2017). The outcomes of patients who had AML within these
                  categories were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival
                  rates in patients with AML were 9\%, 15\%, 22\%, and 28\% in
                  the decades 1980 to 1989, 1990 to 1999, 2000 to 2009, and 2010
                  to 2017, respectively. Among patients aged 15 to 39 years, the
                  5-year survival rates were 24\%, 41\%, 52\%, and 63\%,
                  respectively; among those aged ≥70 years, the 5-year survival
                  rates were 1\%, 2\%, 3\%, and 5\%, respectively. Four-week
                  mortality was surprising high among adults and older patients
                  (range, 20\%-45\%), even in modern times. Overall, survival
                  continued to improve over the calendar periods and was best in
                  the period from 2010 to 2017. Survival improvement was
                  noticeable across all age groups except patients aged ≥70
                  years, in whom the estimated 5-year survival rate remained 5\%
                  even during the period from 2010 to 2017. CONCLUSIONS: The
                  outcomes of patients with AML showed incremental improvement
                  over time in a population-based study of the Surveillance,
                  Epidemiology, and End Results data. The introduction since
                  2017 of targeted therapies among older patients and
                  optimizations in supportive care hopefully will continue to
                  improve outcomes in AML, particularly among older patients.},

                  Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single
                  cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles
                  from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into
                  cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is
                  systematically associated with specific trans-factors and
                  cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors
                  associated with either induction or suppression of
                  cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of
                  trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility
                  variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of
                  cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke
                  stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The
                  pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome
                  recapitulates chromosome compartments de novo, linking
                  single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional
                  genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility
                  provides new insight into cellular variation of the

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1) is frequently
                  mutated in myeloid malignancies. Recent studies showed that
                  hematopoietic-specific deletion of Asxl1 or overexpression of
                  mutant ASXL1 resulted in myelodysplasia-like disease in mice.
                  However, actual effects of a "physiological" dose of mutant
                  ASXL1 remain unexplored. METHODS: We established a knock-in
                  mouse model bearing the most frequent Asxl1 mutation and
                  studied its pathophysiological effects on mouse hematopoietic
                  system. RESULTS: Heterozygotes (Asxl1 tm/+ ) marrow cells had
                  higher in vitro proliferation capacities as shown by more
                  colonies in cobblestone-area forming assays and by serial
                  re-plating assays. On the other hand, donor hematopoietic
                  cells from Asxl1 tm/+ mice declined faster in recipients
                  during transplantation assays, suggesting compromised
                  long-term in vivo repopulation abilities. There were no
                  obvious blood diseases in mutant mice throughout their
                  life-span, indicating Asxl1 mutation alone was not sufficient
                  for leukemogenesis. However, this mutation facilitated
                  engraftment of bone marrow cell overexpressing MN1. Analyses
                  of global gene expression profiles of ASXL1-mutated versus
                  wild-type human leukemia cells as well as heterozygote versus
                  wild-type mouse marrow precursor cells, with or without MN1
                  overexpression, highlighted the association of in vivo Asxl1
                  mutation to the expression of hypoxia, multipotent
                  progenitors, hematopoietic stem cells, KRAS, and MEK gene
                  sets. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed global patterns of Asxl1
                  mutation-modulated H3K27 tri-methylation in hematopoietic
                  precursors. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed the first Asxl1 mutation
                  knock-in mouse model and showed mutated Asxl1 lowered the
                  threshold of MN1-driven engraftment and exhibited distinct
                  biological functions on physiological and malignant
                  hematopoiesis, although it was insufficient to lead to blood

                  components of the clustered regularly interspaced short
                  palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 genome-editing system. The
                  current commonly used sgRNA structure has a shortened duplex
                  compared with the native bacterial CRISPR RNA
                  (crRNA)-transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA) duplex and contains a
                  continuous sequence of thymines, which is the pause signal for
                  RNA polymerase III and thus could potentially reduce
                  transcription efficiency. RESULTS: Here, we systematically
                  investigate the effect of these two elements on knockout
                  efficiency and showed that modifying the sgRNA structure by
                  extending the duplex length and mutating the fourth thymine of
                  the continuous sequence of thymines to cytosine or guanine
                  significantly, and sometimes dramatically, improves knockout
                  efficiency in cells. In addition, the optimized sgRNA
                  structure also significantly increases the efficiency of more
                  challenging genome-editing procedures, such as gene deletion,
                  which is important for inducing a loss of function in
                  non-coding genes. CONCLUSIONS: By a systematic investigation
                  of sgRNA structure we find that extending the duplex by
                  approximately 5 bp combined with mutating the continuous
                  sequence of thymines at position 4 to cytosine or guanine
                  significantly increases gene knockout efficiency in
                  CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing experiments.},

                  haematopoiesis and predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia
                  (AML). The pathophysiology of MDSs remains unclear. A
                  definition of the molecular biology of MDSs may lead to a
                  better classification, new prognosis indicators and new
                  treatments. We studied a series of 40 MDS/AML samples by
                  high-density array-comparative genome hybridization (aCGH).
                  The genome of MDSs displayed a few alterations that can point
                  to candidate genes, which potentially regulate histone
                  modifications and WNT pathways (e.g. ASXL1, ASXL2, UTX, CXXC4,
                  CXXC5, TET2, TET3). To validate some of these candidates we
                  studied the sequence of ASXL1. We found mutations in the ASXL1
                  gene in four out of 35 MDS patients (11\%). To extend these
                  results we searched for mutations of ASXL1 in a series of
                  chronic myelomonocytic leukaemias, a disease classified as
                  MDS/Myeloproliferative disorder, and found mutations in 17 out
                  of 39 patients (43\%). These results show that ASXL1 might

                  megakaryocytes mainly in the bone marrow - are implicated not
                  only in haemostasis and arterial thrombosis, but also in other
                  physiological and pathophysiological processes. This Review
                  describes current evidence for the heterogeneity in platelet
                  structure, age, and activation properties, with consequences
                  for a diversity of platelet functions. Signalling processes of
                  platelet populations involved in thrombus formation with
                  ongoing coagulation are well understood. Genetic approaches
                  have provided information on multiple genes related to normal
                  haemostasis, such as those encoding receptors and signalling
                  or secretory proteins, that determine platelet count and/or
                  responsiveness. As highly responsive and secretory cells,
                  platelets can alter the environment through the release of
                  growth factors, chemokines, coagulant factors, RNA species,
                  and extracellular vesicles. Conversely, platelets will also
                  adapt to their environment. In disease states, platelets can
                  be positively primed to reach a pre-activated condition. At
                  the inflamed vessel wall, platelets interact with leukocytes
                  and the coagulation system, interactions mediating
                  thromboinflammation. With current antiplatelet therapies
                  invariably causing bleeding as an undesired adverse effect,
                  novel therapies can be more beneficial if directed against
                  specific platelet responses, populations, interactions, or
                  priming conditions. On the basis of these novel concepts and
                  processes, we discuss several initiatives to target platelets

                  individuals has changed the way hematologists and stem cell
                  biologists view aging. Somatic mutations accumulate in stem
                  cells over time. While most mutations have no impact, some
                  result in subtle functional differences that ultimately
                  manifest in distinct stem cell behaviors. With a large pool of
                  stem cells and many decades to compete, some of these
                  differences confer advantages under specific contexts.
                  Approximately 20 genes are recurrently found as mutated in CH,
                  indicating they confer some advantage. The impact of these
                  mutations has begun to be analyzed at a molecular level by
                  modeling in cell lines and in mice. Mutations in epigenetic
                  regulators such as DNMT3A and TET2 confer an advantage by
                  enhancing self-renewal of stem and progenitor cells and
                  inhibiting their differentiation. Mutations in other genes
                  involved in the DNA damage response may simply enhance cell
                  survival. Here, we review proposed mechanisms that lead to CH,
                  specifically in the context of stem cell biology, based on our
                  current understanding of the function of some of the

                  1 (ASXL1) is an adverse prognostic factor in acute myeloid
                  leukemia (AML). However, the mutational spectrum and
                  prognostic factors of ASXL1-mutated (ASXL1+) AML are largely
                  unknown. We aim to evaluate the risk factors influencing the
                  prognosis of ASXL1+ AML. METHODS: We performed next-generation
                  sequencing (NGS) in 1047 cases of de novo AML and discovered
                  91 ASXL1+ AML (8.7\%). The Log-Rank test and Kaplan-Meier were
                  used to evaluate survival rate, and the Cox regression model
                  was used to analyze multivariate analysis. RESULTS: In a total
                  of 91 ASXL1+ AML, 86\% had one or more co-mutations. The
                  factors that had adverse impact on overall survival (OS) and
                  event-free survival (EFS) are defined as high risk factors,
                  including age ≥ 60 years, WBC count ≥ 50 × 109/L, FLT3-ITD
                  mutations, RUNX1 mutations, and absence of AML1-ETO fusion
                  gene. ASXL1 mutations without any risk factor were classified
                  as single-hit ASXL1+ AML; ASXL1 mutations accompanied with one
                  of the risk factors was referred to as double-hit ASXL1+ AML;
                  ASXL1 mutations with two or more of the risk factors were
                  designated as triple-hit ASXL1+ AML. The combination of these
                  risk factors had a negative influence on the prognosis of
                  ASXL1+ AML. The median OS was not attained in single-hit
                  ASXL1+ AML, 29.53 months in double-hit ASXL1+ AML, and 6.67
                  months in triple-hit ASXL1+ AML (P = 0.003). The median EFS
                  was not attained in single-hit ASXL1+ AML, 29.53 months in
                  double-hit ASXL1+ AML, and 5.47 months in triple-hit ASXL1+
                  AML (P = 0.002). Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell
                  transplantation (allo-HSCT) improved the prognosis of
                  double/triple-hit ASXL1+ AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study
                  provided new insights into the mutational spectrum and
                  prognostic factors of ASXL1+ AML patients. Our primary data
                  suggest that the risk factors in ASXL1+ AML contribute to the
                  poor outcome of these patients. The management of ASXL1+ AML
                  patients should be based on the risk factors and allo-HSCT is
                  highly recommended for consolidation.},

                  the COMPASS family includes the propensity to mono-, di-, or
                  trimethylate H3K4 and to regulate promoters or enhancers.
                  Recent cancer genome sequencing and animal studies have
                  identified MLL3 and MLL4 as cancer drivers in a wide variety
                  of hematologic and solid tumors. MLL3 and MLL4 implement
                  monomethylation of H3K4 at enhancer regions, whereas another
                  enzyme in MLL3 and MLL4 COMPASS, UTX, which is also frequently
                  mutated in multiple types of cancer, demethylates H3K27me3, a
                  modification associated with transcription repression by the
                  Polycomb group of proteins. Here, we review the different
                  roles for the COMPASS family in cancer and suggest directions
                  for future research toward elucidating the cellular pathways
                  disregulated due to altered COMPASS functions.},

                  trimethylated by members of the COMPASS (complex of proteins
                  associated with Set1) family from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to
                  humans, and these modifications can be found at distinct
                  regions of the genome. Monomethylation of histone H3K4
                  (H3K4me1) is relatively more enriched at metazoan enhancer
                  regions compared to trimethylated histone H3K4 (H3K4me3),
                  which is enriched at transcription start sites in all
                  eukaryotes. Our recent studies of Drosophila melanogaster
                  demonstrated that the Trithorax-related (Trr) branch of the
                  COMPASS family regulates enhancer activity and is responsible
                  for the implementation of H3K4me1 at these regions. There are
                  six COMPASS family members in mammals, two of which, MLL3
                  (GeneID 58508) and MLL4 (GeneID 8085), are most closely
                  related to Drosophila Trr. Here, we use chromatin
                  immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) of this class of
                  COMPASS family members in both human HCT116 cells and mouse
                  embryonic stem cells and find that MLL4 is preferentially
                  found at enhancer regions. MLL3 and MLL4 are frequently
                  mutated in cancer, and indeed, the widely used HCT116 cancer
                  cell line contains inactivating mutations in the MLL3 gene.
                  Using HCT116 cells in which MLL4 has also been knocked out, we
                  demonstrate that MLL3 and MLL4 are major regulators of H3K4me1
                  in these cells, with the greatest loss of monomethylation at
                  enhancer regions. Moreover, we find a redundant role between
                  Mll3 (GeneID 231051) and Mll4 (GeneID 381022) in enhancer H3K4
                  monomethylation in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells.
                  These findings suggest that mammalian MLL3 and MLL4 function
                  in the regulation of enhancer activity and that mutations of
                  MLL3 and MLL4 that are found in cancers could exert their
                  properties through malfunction of these Trr/MLL3/MLL4-specific
                  (Trrific) enhancers.},

                  inhibition of epigenetic regulators is emerging as a promising
                  therapeutic strategy. The acetylation status of lysine
                  residues in histone tails is one of a number of epigenetic
                  post-translational modifications that alter DNA-templated
                  processes, such as transcription, to facilitate malignant
                  transformation. Although histone deacetylases are already
                  being clinically targeted, the role of histone lysine
                  acetyltransferases (KAT) in malignancy is less well

                  Furthermore, using selective small molecule inhibitors of

                  finally demonstrate the efficacy of the KAT inhibitors in
                  decreasing clonogenic growth of primary AML patient samples.

                  (UMAP) is applied for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and
                  visualization of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data. We
                  evaluate the performance of the UMAP algorithm on MSI data
                  sets acquired in mouse pancreas and human lymphoma samples and
                  compare it to those of principal component analysis (PCA),
                  t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and the
                  Barnes-Hut (BH) approximation of t-SNE. Furthermore, we
                  compare different distance metrics in (BH) t-SNE and UMAP and
                  propose the use of spatial autocorrelation as a means of
                  comparing the resulting low-dimensional embeddings. The
                  results indicate that UMAP is competitive with t-SNE in terms
                  of visualization and is well-suited for the dimensionality
                  reduction of large (>100 000 pixels) MSI data sets. With an
                  almost fourfold decrease in runtime, it is more scalable in
                  comparison with the current state-of-the-art: t-SNE or the
                  Barnes-Hut approximation of t-SNE. In what seems to be the
                  first application of UMAP to MSI data, we assess the value of
                  applying alternative distance metrics, such as the
                  correlation, cosine, and the Chebyshev metric, in contrast to
                  the traditionally used Euclidean distance metric. Furthermore,
                  we propose "histomatch" as an additional custom distance

                  factors, the pioneer transcription factors, can specifically
                  recognize their DNA binding sites on nucleosomes, initiate
                  local chromatin opening and facilitate the binding of

                  resolution it is becoming clear that there is considerable
                  variation in the 3D chromatin architecture across different
                  cell types. It has been proposed that this may, in part, be
                  due to increased recruitment of cohesin to activated
                  cis-elements (enhancers and promoters) leading to cell-type
                  specific loop extrusion underlying the formation of new
                  subTADs. Here we show that cohesin correlates well with the
                  presence of active enhancers and this varies in an
                  allele-specific manner with the presence or absence of
                  polymorphic enhancers which vary from one individual to
                  another. Using the alpha globin cluster as a model, we show
                  that when all enhancers are removed, peaks of cohesin
                  disappear from these regions and the erythroid specific subTAD
                  is no longer formed. Re-insertion of the major alpha globin
                  enhancer (R2) is associated with the appearance of a new peak
                  of cohesin at the site of insertion. In complementary
                  experiments insertion of R2 into a “neutral” region of the
                  genome recruits cohesin, induces transcription and creates a
                  new large (75kb) erythroid specific domain. Together these
                  findings support the proposal that active enhancers recruit
                  cohesin, stimulate loop extrusion and promote the formation of
                  cell specific subTADs. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement

                  capacity to define cell states and reveal developmental
                  trajectories. Resolution is challenged, however, by high
                  dimensionality and noisy data. Analysis is therefore typically
                  performed after sub-setting to highly variable genes (HVGs).
                  However, existing HVG selection techniques have been found to
                  have poor agreement with one another, and tend to be biased
                  towards highly expressed genes. Entropy sorting provides an
                  alternative mathematical framework for feature subset
                  selection. Here we implement continuous entropy sort feature
                  weighting (cESFW). On synthetic datasets, cESFW outperforms
                  HVG selection in distinguishing cell state specific genes. We
                  apply cESFW to six merged scRNA-seq datasets spanning human
                  early embryo development. Without smoothing or augmenting the
                  raw counts matrices, cESFW generates a high-resolution
                  embedding displaying coherent developmental progression from
                  8-cell to post-implantation stages, delineating 15 distinct
                  cell states. The embedding highlights sequential lineage
                  decisions during blastocyst development while unsupervised
                  clustering identifies branch point populations. Cells
                  previously claimed to lack a developmental trajectory reside
                  in the first branching region where morula differentiates into
                  Inner Cell Mass (ICM) or Trophectoderm (TE). We quantify the
                  relatedness of pluripotent stem cell cultures to embryo cell
                  types and identify naive and primed marker genes conserved
                  across culture conditions and the human embryo. Finally, by
                  identifying genes with specifically enriched and dynamic
                  expression during blastocyst formation, we provide markers for
                  staging lineage progression from morula to blastocyst.
                  Together these analyses indicate that cESFW provides the
                  ability to reveal gene expression dynamics in scRNA-seq data
                  that HVG selection can fail to elucidate. \#\#\# Competing

                  present in the CML cell line KBM5, which lacks ASXL1 protein

                  myeloid cell differentiation during cancer is crucial to
                  counteract their pro-tumourigenic role. Bone marrow (BM)
                  haematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process for the
                  production of all immune cells in accordance to tissue
                  needs14. Myeloid cells differentiate during haematopoiesis
                  from multipotent haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
                  (HSPCs)15–17. HSPCs can sense inflammatory signals from the
                  periphery during infections18–21 or inflammatory
                  disorders22–27. In these settings, HSPC expansion is
                  associated with increased myeloid differentiation28,29. During
                  carcinogenesis, the elevation of haematopoietic growth factors
                  supports the expansion and differentiation of committed
                  myeloid progenitors5,30. However, it is unclear whether
                  cancer-related inflammation also triggers demand-adapted
                  haematopoiesis at the level of multipotent HSPCs. In the BM,
                  HSPCs reside within the haematopoietic niche which delivers
                  HSC maintenance and differentiation cues31–35. Mesenchymal
                  stem cells (MSCs) are a major cellular component of the BM
                  niche and contribute to HSC homeostasis36–41. Modifications of
                  MSCs in systemic disorders have been associated with HSC

                  MSCs are regulated in the context of solid tumours and if
                  their myeloid supportive activity is impacted by
                  cancer-induced systemic changes. Here, using unbiased
                  transcriptomic analysis and in situ imaging of HSCs and the BM
                  niche during breast cancer, we show that both HSCs and MSCs
                  are transcriptionally and spatially modified. We demonstrate
                  that breast tumour can distantly remodel the cellular
                  cross-talks in the BM niche leading to increased myelopoiesis.

                  one or two modalities at a time, making it challenging to

                  chromatin architecture. However, the causal relationships
                  between these features and the key regulators of DNA
                  replication timing (RT) are largely unknown. Here, machine
                  learning was applied to quantify chromatin features, including
                  epigenetic marks, histone variants and chromatin architectural
                  factors, best predicting local RT under steady-state and RT
                  changes during early embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation.
                  About one-third of genome exhibited RT changes during the
                  differentiation. Combined, chromatin features predicted
                  steady-state RT and RT changes with high accuracy. Of these
                  features, histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1)
                  catalyzed by MLL3/4 (also known as KMT2C/D) emerged as a top
                  predictor. Loss ofMll3/4(but notMll3alone) or their enzymatic
                  activity resulted in erasure of genome-wide RT dynamics during
                  ES cell differentiation. Sites that normally gain H3K4me1 in a
                  MLL3/4-dependent fashion during the transition failed to
                  transition towards earlier RT, often with transcriptional
                  activation unaffected. Further analysis revealed a requirement
                  for MLL3/4 in promoting DNA replication initiation zones
                  through MCM2 recruitment, providing a direct link for its role
                  in regulating RT. Our results uncover MLL3/4-dependent H3K4me1
                  as a functional regulator of RT and highlight a causal
                  relationship between the epigenome and RT that is largely
                  uncoupled from transcription. These findings uncover a
                  previously unknown role for MLL3/4-dependent chromatin
                  functions which is likely relevant to the numerous diseases

                  increases dramatically with age. CH can be caused by somatic
                  mutations in individual genes or by gains and or losses of
                  larger chromosomal segments. CH is a premalignant state; the
                  somatic mutations detected in CH are the initiating mutations
                  for hematologic malignancies, and CH is a strong predictor for
                  the development of blood cancers. Moreover, CH is associated
                  with non-malignant disorders and increased overall mortality.
                  The somatic mutations that drive clonal expansion of HSPCs can
                  alter the function of terminally differentiated blood cells,
                  including release of elevated levels of inflammatory

                  in terms of evolutionary entropy, a statistical measure of the
                  cooperativity of the interacting components. Evolutionary
                  entropy describes the rate at which a network of interacting
                  metabolic units convert an external energy source into
                  mechanical energy and work. We invoke Directionality Theory,
                  an analytic model of Darwinian evolution to analyze
                  self-assembly as a variation-selection process, and to derive
                  a general tenet, namely, the Entropic Principle of
                  Self-Organization: The equilibrium states of a self-organizing

                  critical role in leukemia transformation and maintenance, and
                  its aberrant expression is a hallmark of most aggressive acute
                  leukemia. Although inhibiting the upstream regulators of HOXA9
                  has been proven as a significant therapeutic intervention, the
                  comprehensive regulation network controlling HOXA9 expression
                  in leukemia has not been systematically investigated. Results
                  Here, we perform genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening in the
                  HOXA9-driven reporter acute leukemia cells. We identify a
                  poorly characterized RNA-binding protein, RBM5, as the top
                  candidate gene required to maintain leukemia cell fitness.
                  RBM5 is highly overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
                  patients compared to healthy individuals. RBM5 loss triggered
                  by CRISPR knockout and shRNA knockdown significantly impairs
                  leukemia maintenance in vitro and in vivo. Through domain
                  CRISPR screening, we reveal that RBM5 functions through a
                  noncanonical transcriptional regulation circuitry rather than
                  RNA splicing, such an effect depending on DNA-binding domains.
                  By integrative analysis and functional assays, we identify
                  HOXA9 as the downstream target of RBM5. Ectopic expression of
                  HOXA9 rescues impaired leukemia cell proliferation upon RBM5
                  loss. Importantly, acute protein degradation of RBM5 through
                  auxin-inducible degron system immediately reduces HOXA9
                  transcription. Conclusions We identify RBM5 as a new upstream
                  regulator of HOXA9 and reveal its essential role in
                  controlling the survival of AML. These functional and
                  molecular mechanisms further support RBM5 as a promising
                  therapeutic target for myeloid leukemia treatment.},

                  of large and complex networks. One of the most popular
                  algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called
                  Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major
                  defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain
                  algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities.
                  In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected,
                  especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our
                  experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the
                  communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are
                  disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden
                  algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields
                  communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition,
                  we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied
                  iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets
                  of all communities are locally optimally assigned.
                  Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the
                  Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We
                  demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for
                  several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the
                  Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and

                  harnessed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to study tumor
                  phenotypes by ascertaining nucleosome positioning patterns
                  associated with transcription regulation. We sequenced plasma
                  ctDNA whole genomes from patient-derived xenografts
                  representing a spectrum of androgen receptor active (ARPC) and
                  neuroendocrine (NEPC) prostate cancers. Nucleosome patterns
                  associated with transcriptional activity were reflected in
                  ctDNA at regions of genes, promoters, histone modifications,
                  transcription factor binding, and accessible chromatin. We
                  identified the activity of key phenotype-defining
                  transcriptional regulators from ctDNA, including AR, ASCL1,

                  achieved accuracies of 97\% for dominant phenotypes and 87\%
                  for mixed clinical phenotypes. Although phenotype
                  classification is typically assessed by IHC or transcriptome

                  vitro studies have shown that transcription proceeds with
                  different efficiency depending on the orientation of the DNA
                  sequence around them. However, it is unclear whether this
                  functional asymmetry is present in vivo and whether it could
                  regulate transcriptional directionality. Here, we report that
                  the proximal and distal halves of nucleosomal DNA contribute
                  differentially to nucleosome stability in the genome. In +1
                  nucleosomes, this asymmetry facilitates or hinders
                  transcription depending on the orientation of its underlying
                  DNA, and this difference is associated with an asymmetrical
                  interaction between DNA and histones. These properties are
                  encoded in the DNA signature of +1 nucleosomes, since its
                  incorporation in the two orientations into downstream
                  nucleosomes renders them asymmetrically accessible to MNase
                  and inverts the balance between sense and antisense
                  transcription. Altogether, our results show that nucleosomal

                  histone modifications and open chromatin sites provide
                  valuable information for annotating the non-coding genome,
                  including identifying regulatory elements. Computational
                  approaches such as ChromHMM have been applied to discover and
                  annotate chromatin states defined by combinatorial and spatial
                  patterns of chromatin marks within the same cell type. An
                  alternative "stacked modeling" approach was previously
                  suggested, where chromatin states are defined jointly from
                  datasets of multiple cell types to produce a single universal
                  genome annotation based on all datasets. Despite its potential
                  benefits for applications that are not specific to one cell
                  type, such an approach was previously applied only for
                  small-scale specialized purposes. Large-scale applications of
                  stacked modeling have previously posed scalability challenges.
                  RESULTS: Using a version of ChromHMM enhanced for large-scale
                  applications, we apply the stacked modeling approach to
                  produce a universal chromatin state annotation of the human
                  genome using over 1000 datasets from more than 100 cell types,
                  with the learned model denoted as the full-stack model. The
                  full-stack model states show distinct enrichments for external
                  genomic annotations, which we use in characterizing each
                  state. Compared to per-cell-type annotations, the full-stack
                  annotations directly differentiate constitutive from cell
                  type-specific activity and is more predictive of locations of
                  external genomic annotations. CONCLUSIONS: The full-stack
                  ChromHMM model provides a universal chromatin state annotation
                  of the genome and a unified global view of over 1000 datasets.
                  We expect this to be a useful resource that complements
                  existing per-cell-type annotations for studying the non-coding

                  In a comparison with two existing tools, ChromHMM, Segway and

                  entropy sorting (ES), a mathematical framework that
                  distinguishes genes indicative of cell identity. ES achieves

                  correlations between features are more likely to have occurred
                  due to random chance versus a dependent relationship, without
                  the need for any user-defined significance threshold. On

                  maps of 53 broadly selected chromatin components in Drosophila
                  cells, we show that the genome is segmented into five

                  remains unclear. Using adipogenesis as a model system, we

                  will argue that the major problem that hampers progress in
                  translational research is threefold. First, in order to
                  establish biological foundations of disorders or general
                  complex phenotypes, one needs to embrace emergence. Second,
                  there seems to be confusion about the underlying hypotheses
                  tested by omics studies. Third, most contemporary omics
                  studies are designed to perform what can be seen as
                  incremental corroborations of a hypothesis. In order to
                  improve upon these shortcomings, we define a severe testing
                  framework (STF) that can be applied to a large number of omics
                  studies for enhancing scientific discovery in the biomedical

                  factors that operate in a regulatory network to activate
                  B-lineage genes and repress lineage-inappropriate genes.
                  However, the dynamics and hierarchy of events in B-cell
                  programming remain obscure. To uncouple the dynamics of
                  transcription factor expression from functional consequences,
                  we generated induction systems in developmentally arrested
                  Ebf1-/- pre-pro-B cells to allow precise experimental control
                  of EBF1 expression in the genomic context of progenitor cells.
                  Consistent with the described role of EBF1 as a pioneer
                  transcription factor, we show in a time-resolved analysis that
                  EBF1 occupancy coincides with EBF1 expression and precedes the
                  formation of chromatin accessibility. We observed dynamic
                  patterns of EBF1 target gene expression and sequential
                  up-regulation of transcription factors that expand the
                  regulatory network at the pro-B-cell stage. A continuous EBF1
                  function was found to be required for Cd79a promoter activity
                  and for the maintenance of an accessible chromatin domain that
                  is permissive for binding of other transcription factors.
                  Notably, transient EBF1 occupancy was detected at
                  lineage-inappropriate genes prior to their silencing in pro-B
                  cells. Thus, persistent and transient functions of EBF1 allow
                  for an ordered sequence of epigenetic and transcriptional

                  frequently mutated in B-lymphoid leukemias, suggesting a close
                  link between normal and malignant B-cell development. One of
                  these transcription factors is early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1), a
                  protein of critical importance for lineage specification and
                  survival of B-lymphoid progenitors. Here, we report that
                  impaired EBF1 function in mouse B-cell progenitors results in
                  reduced expression of Myc. Ectopic expression of MYC partially
                  rescued B-cell expansion in the absence of EBF1 both in vivo
                  and in vitro. Using chromosome conformation analysis in
                  combination with ATAC-sequencing, chromatin
                  immunoprecipitation-sequencing, and reporter gene assays, six
                  EBF1-responsive enhancer elements were identified within the
                  Myc locus. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated targeting of EBF1-binding
                  sites identified one element of key importance for Myc
                  expression and pro-B cell expansion. These data provide
                  evidence that Myc is a direct target of EBF1. Furthermore,
                  chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis revealed
                  that several regulatory elements in the Myc locus are targets
                  of PAX5. However, ectopic expression of PAX5 in EBF1-deficient
                  cells inhibits the cell cycle and reduces Myc expression,
                  suggesting that EBF1 and PAX5 act in an opposing manner to
                  regulate Myc levels. This hypothesis is further substantiated
                  by the finding that Pax5 inactivation reduces requirements for
                  EBF1 in pro-B-cell expansion. The binding of EBF1 and PAX5 to
                  regulatory elements in the human MYC gene in a B-cell acute
                  lymphoblastic leukemia cell line indicates that the
                  EBF1:PAX5:MYC regulatory loop is conserved and may control

                  regions prior to the detection of chromatin accessibility in a
                  manner dependent on EBF1's C-terminal domain (CTD) and

                  a prion-like domain (PLD) with an ability of liquid-liquid
                  phase separation, which was enhanced by interaction of EBF1
                  with the RNA-binding protein FUS. Brg1 also partitioned into
                  phase-separated FUS condensates and coincided with EBF1 and

                  regulators, named microRNAs, has changed the landscape of
                  human genetics. In hematopoiesis, recent work has improved our
                  understanding of the role of microRNAs in hematopoietic
                  differentiation and leukemogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Using
                  animal models engineered to overexpress miR-150, miR-17
                  approximately 92 and miR-155 or to be deficient for miR-223,
                  miR-155 and miR-17 approximately 92 expression, several groups
                  have now shown that miRNAs are critical for B-lymphocyte
                  development (miR-150 and miR-17 approximately 92),
                  granulopoiesis (miR-223), immune function (miR-155) and
                  B-lymphoproliferative disorders (miR-155 and miR-17
                  approximately 92). Distinctive miRNA signatures have been
                  described in association with cytogenetics and outcome in
                  acute myeloid leukemia. SUMMARY: There is now strong evidence
                  that miRNAs modulate not only hematopoietic differentiation
                  and proliferation but also activity of hematopoietic cells, in
                  particular those related to immune function. Extensive miRNA
                  deregulation has been observed in leukemias and lymphomas and

                  further marked by H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac). Mixed-lineage
                  leukemia 4 (MLL4/KMT2D) is a major enhancer H3K4me1/2
                  methyltransferase with functional redundancy with MLL3
                  (KMT2C). However, its role in cell fate maintenance and
                  transition is poorly understood. Here, we show in mouse
                  embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that MLL4 associates with, but is
                  surprisingly dispensable for the maintenance of, active
                  enhancers of cell-identity genes. As a result, MLL4 is
                  dispensable for cell-identity gene expression and self-renewal

                  MLL4 protein, rather than MLL4-mediated H3K4 methylation,

                  identity but essential for reprogramming into induced

                  enhancer priming by MLL4 is dispensable for cell-identity
                  maintenance, it controls cell fate transition by orchestrating

                  implements histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) at

                  cells in mice defines stable lineage-restricted fates in
                  long-term self-renewing multipotent stem cells, including a
                  class of multipotent stem cells that exclusively replenishes
                  the megakaryocyte/platelet lineage. Many blood disorders can
                  be treated with haematopoietic (blood-generating) stem cell
                  (HSC) transplants, but such treatment does not always lead to
                  efficient replenishment of all blood lineages. Through
                  single-cell transplantation of HSCs in mice, Sten Eirik
                  Jacobsen and colleagues define lineage-restricted fates of
                  long-term self-renewing cells. They identify a class of HSC
                  that effectively replenishes the megakaryocyte and platelet
                  lineages over other lineages, and other HSCs that are more
                  able to participate in megakaryocyte, erythroid and myeloid
                  lineages despite being able to sustain lymphoid potential.
                  Genetic lineage tracing also shows that platelet-biased HSCs
                  are able to support unperturbed adult haematopoiesis. Rare
                  multipotent haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in adult bone
                  marrow with extensive self-renewal potential can efficiently
                  replenish all myeloid and lymphoid blood cells1, securing
                  long-term multilineage reconstitution after physiological and
                  clinical challenges such as chemotherapy and haematopoietic
                  transplantations2,3,4. HSC transplantation remains the only
                  curative treatment for many haematological malignancies, but
                  inefficient blood-lineage replenishment remains a major cause
                  of morbidity and mortality5,6. Single-cell transplantation has
                  uncovered considerable heterogeneity among reconstituting
                  HSCs7,8,9,10,11, a finding that is supported by studies of
                  unperturbed haematopoiesis2,3,4,12 and may reflect different
                  propensities for lineage-fate decisions by distinct myeloid-,
                  lymphoid- and platelet-biased HSCs7,8,9,10,13. Other studies
                  suggested that such lineage bias might reflect generation of
                  unipotent or oligopotent self-renewing progenitors within the
                  phenotypic HSC compartment, and implicated uncoupling of the
                  defining HSC properties of self-renewal and multipotency11,14.
                  Here we use highly sensitive tracking of progenitors and
                  mature cells of the megakaryocyte/platelet, erythroid, myeloid
                  and B and T cell lineages, produced from singly transplanted
                  HSCs, to reveal a highly organized, predictable and stable
                  framework for lineage-restricted fates of long-term
                  self-renewing HSCs. Most notably, a distinct class of HSCs
                  adopts a fate towards effective and stable replenishment of a
                  megakaryocyte/platelet-lineage tree but not of other blood
                  cell lineages, despite sustained multipotency. No HSCs
                  contribute exclusively to any other single blood-cell lineage.
                  Single multipotent HSCs can also fully restrict towards
                  simultaneous replenishment of megakaryocyte, erythroid and
                  myeloid lineages without executing their sustained lymphoid
                  lineage potential. Genetic lineage-tracing analysis also
                  provides evidence for an important role of platelet-biased
                  HSCs in unperturbed adult haematopoiesis. These findings
                  uncover a limited repertoire of distinct HSC subsets, defined
                  by a predictable and hierarchical propensity to adopt a fate
                  towards replenishment of a restricted set of blood lineages,
                  before loss of self-renewal and multipotency.},

                  Tagmentation (MulTI-Tag), an antibody barcoding approach for
                  profiling multiple chromatin features simultaneously in single
                  cells. We optimized MulTI-Tag to retain high sensitivity and
                  specificity, and we demonstrate detection of up to three
                  histone modifications in the same cell: H3K27me3, H3K4me1/2
                  and H3K36me3. We apply MulTI-Tag to resolve distinct cell
                  types and developmental trajectories; to distinguish unique,
                  coordinated patterns of active and repressive element
                  regulatory usage associated with differentiation outcomes; and
                  to uncover associations between histone marks. Multifactorial
                  epigenetic profiling holds promise for comprehensively

                  the heterogeneous functional and dysfunctional states of human
                  tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is incompletely
                  understood. Here, we identify gene-regulatory landscapes in a
                  wide breadth of functional and dysfunctional CD8+ TIL states
                  covering four cancer entities using single-cell chromatin
                  profiling. We map enhancer-promoter interactions in human TILs
                  by integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility with
                  single-cell RNA-seq data from tumor-entity-matching samples

                  genes critical for lineage determination. The activity of
                  enhancer elements is believed to be determined by
                  transcription factor binding, thus determining the cell state

                  to enhancers. Thus, enhancers are the primary determinants of
                  cell identity. Numerous studies have explored the role and

                  marks in single cells, but most methods are constrained to
                  profile only one histone mark per cell. Here, we present an
                  integrated experimental and computational framework,
                  scChIX-seq (single-cell chromatin immunocleavage and unmixing
                  sequencing), to map several histone marks in single cells.
                  scChIX-seq multiplexes two histone marks together in single
                  cells, then computationally deconvolves the signal using
                  training data from respective histone mark profiles. This
                  framework learns the cell-type-specific correlation structure
                  between histone marks, and therefore does not require a priori
                  assumptions of their genomic distributions. Using scChIX-seq,
                  we demonstrate multimodal analysis of histone marks in single
                  cells across a range of mark combinations. Modeling dynamics
                  of in vitro macrophage differentiation enables integrated
                  analysis of chromatin velocity. Overall, scChIX-seq unlocks
                  systematic interrogation of the interplay between histone

                  unexplored. We develop sort-assisted single-cell chromatin

                  course and utilize mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations as

                  strong selective pressure, indicating clonal persistence, but
                  dramatic changes following tight bottlenecks, including

                  conversion events based on combinatorial and traceable
                  reprogramming factor expression: Collide-seq. Collide-seq
                  revealed the lack of a common mechanism through which

                  Moreover, we found that the transcriptome of converting cells

                  that affect homologous desensitization of the receptor have
                  been reported in the WHIM Syndrome (WS), a rare
                  immunodeficiency characterized by lymphopenia. The mechanisms
                  underpinning this remain obscure. Using a mouse model with a
                  naturally occurring WS-linked gain-of-function Cxcr4 mutation,
                  we explored the possibility that the lymphopenia in WS arises

                  desensitization is required for quiescence/cycling balance of
                  murine short-term hematopoietic stem cells and their
                  differentiation into multipotent and downstream
                  lymphoid-biased progenitors. Alteration in Cxcr4
                  desensitization resulted in decrease of circulating HSPCs in
                  five patients with WS. This was also evidenced in WS mice and
                  mirrored by accumulation of HSPCs in the spleen, where we
                  observed enhanced extramedullary hematopoiesis. Therefore,
                  efficient Cxcr4 desensitization is critical for lymphoid
                  differentiation of HSPCs, and its impairment is a key
                  mechanism underpinning the lymphopenia observed in mice and

                  mutations of KDM6A are more rare in human AML samples, ranging
                  in frequency from 2-15\% in different series of patients,
                  where their role in pathogenesis is not yet clear. In this
                  study, we show that female Kdm6aflox/flox mice (with allele
                  inactivation initiated by Vav1-Cre in hematopoietic stem and
                  progenitor cells (HSPCs) have a sex-specific phenotype that
                  emerges with aging, with features resembling a myelodysplastic
                  syndrome (MDS). Female Kdm6a-knockout (KO) mice have an
                  age-dependent expansion of their HSPCs with aberrant
                  self-renewal, but they did not differentiate normally into
                  downstream progeny. These mice became mildly anemic and
                  thrombocytopenic, but did not develop overt leukemia, or die
                  from these cytopenias. ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq studies showed
                  only minor changes in H3K27me3, H3K27ac, H3K4me, H3K4me3 and
                  chromatin accessibility between Kdm6a-WT and Kdm6a-KO mice.
                  Utilizing scRNA-seq, Kdm6a loss was linked to the
                  transcriptional repression of genes that mediate hematopoietic
                  cell fate determination. These data demonstrate that Kdm6a
                  plays an important role in normal hematopoiesis, and that its
                  inactivation may contribute to AML pathogenesis.},

                  detecting the number of cell types, which is inevitable in
                  human studies. The majority of scRNA-seq algorithms have been
                  specifically designed to remove batch effect firstly and then
                  conduct clustering, which may miss some rare cell types. Here
                  we develop scDML, a deep metric learning model to remove batch
                  effect in scRNA-seq data, guided by the initial clusters and
                  the nearest neighbor information intra and inter batches.
                  Comprehensive evaluations spanning different species and
                  tissues demonstrated that scDML can remove batch effect,
                  improve clustering performance, accurately recover true cell

                  enables discovery of new cell subtypes that are hard to

                  that scDML is scalable to large datasets with lower peak
                  memory usage, and we believe that scDML offers a valuable tool
                  to study complex cellular heterogeneity. The increasing scale

                  well as a constellation of somatic structural DNA alterations

                  disease. Remarkably, in the last five years, a number of
                  studies involving single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
                  allowed the discovery of new immune cell types and revealed
                  that haematopoiesis is a continuous rather than a stepwise
                  process, thus challenging the classical haematopoietic lineage
                  tree model. This review summarises the most recent studies
                  which applied scRNA-seq to answer outstanding questions in the
                  fields of haematology and immunology and discusses the present

                  (HPC) cell self-renewal. The role of Brahma (BRM), a chromatin
                  remodeler, in HSC function is unknown. Bone marrow (BM) from
                  Brm-/- mice manifested increased numbers of long- and
                  short-term HSCs, GMPs, and increased numbers and cycling of
                  functional HPCs. However, increased Brm-/- BM HSC numbers had
                  decreased secondary and tertiary engraftment, suggesting BRM
                  enhances HSC self-renewal. Valine was elevated in lineage
                  negative Brm-/- BM cells, linking intracellular valine with
                  Brm expression. Valine enhanced HPC colony formation,
                  replating of human cord blood (CB) HPC-derived colonies, mouse
                  BM and human CB HPC survival in vitro, and ex vivo expansion
                  of normal mouse BM HSCs and HPCs. Valine increased oxygen
                  consumption rates of WT cells. BRM through CD98 was linked to
                  regulated import of branched chain amino acids, such as
                  valine, in HPCs. Brm-/- LSK cells exhibited upregulated
                  interferon response/cell cycle gene programs. Effects of BRM
                  depletion are less apparent on isolated HSCs compared to HSCs
                  in the presence of HPCs, suggesting cell extrinsic effects on
                  HSCs. Thus, intracellular valine is regulated by BRM
                  expression in HPCs, and the BRM/valine axis regulates HSC and
                  HPC self-renewal, proliferation, and possibly differentiation

                  analysis of more than 14,000 genes identified 1,500 that were
                  age-induced and 1,600 that were age-repressed. Genes
                  associated with the stress response, inflammation, and protein
                  aggregation dominated the up-regulated expression profile,

                  in the preservation of genomic integrity and chromatin
                  remodeling. Many chromosomal regions showed coordinate loss of

                  (AML) initially respond to chemotherapy, many of them
                  subsequently relapse, and the mechanistic basis for AML
                  persistence following chemotherapy has not been determined.
                  Recurrent somatic mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A
                  (DNMT3A), most frequently at arginine 882 (DNMT3AR882), have
                  been observed in AML and in individuals with clonal
                  hematopoiesis in the absence of leukemic transformation.
                  Patients with DNMT3AR882 AML have an inferior outcome when
                  treated with standard-dose daunorubicin-based induction
                  chemotherapy, suggesting that DNMT3AR882 cells persist and
                  drive relapse. We found that Dnmt3a mutations induced
                  hematopoietic stem cell expansion, cooperated with mutations
                  in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (Flt3ITD) and the
                  nucleophosmin gene (Npm1c) to induce AML in vivo, and promoted
                  resistance to anthracycline chemotherapy. In patients with
                  AML, the presence of DNMT3AR882 mutations predicts minimal
                  residual disease, underscoring their role in AML
                  chemoresistance. DNMT3AR882 cells showed impaired nucleosome
                  eviction and chromatin remodeling in response to anthracycline
                  treatment, which resulted from attenuated recruitment of
                  histone chaperone SPT-16 following anthracycline exposure.
                  This defect led to an inability to sense and repair DNA
                  torsional stress, which resulted in increased mutagenesis. Our
                  findings identify a crucial role for DNMT3AR882 mutations in
                  driving AML chemoresistance and highlight the importance of
                  chromatin remodeling in response to cytotoxic chemotherapy.},

                  particular, accumulating evidence is defining a role of
                  epigenetic mechanisms as being critical in this continuous
                  spectrum between autoimmunity and lymphoma. In this review, we
                  focus attention predominantly on the relationships between T
                  helper 17 (Th17) and T regulatory populations that alter local

                  involved in Th17 and/or Treg development alter immune

                  Although more than 70 trajectory inference tools have already

                  technology has enhanced the analysis of cell development by
                  profiling heterogeneous cells in individual cell resolution.
                  In recent years, many trajectory inference methods have been
                  developed. They have focused on using the graph method to
                  infer the trajectory using single-cell data, and then
                  calculate the geodesic distance as the pseudotime. However,
                  these methods are vulnerable to errors caused by the inferred
                  trajectory. Therefore, the calculated pseudotime suffers from
                  such errors. RESULTS: We proposed a novel framework for
                  trajectory inference called the single-cell data Trajectory
                  inference method using Ensemble Pseudotime inference (scTEP).
                  scTEP utilizes multiple clustering results to infer robust
                  pseudotime and then uses the pseudotime to fine-tune the
                  learned trajectory. We evaluated the scTEP using 41 real
                  scRNA-seq data sets, all of which had the ground truth
                  development trajectory. We compared the scTEP with
                  state-of-the-art methods using the aforementioned data sets.
                  Experiments on real linear and non-linear data sets
                  demonstrate that our scTEP performed superior on more data
                  sets than any other method. The scTEP also achieved a higher
                  average and lower variance on most metrics than other
                  state-of-the-art methods. In terms of trajectory inference
                  capacity, the scTEP outperforms those methods. In addition,
                  the scTEP is more robust to the unavoidable errors resulting
                  from clustering and dimension reduction. CONCLUSION: The scTEP
                  demonstrates that utilizing multiple clustering results for
                  the pseudotime inference procedure enhances its robustness.
                  Furthermore, robust pseudotime strengthens the accuracy of
                  trajectory inference, which is the most crucial component in
                  the pipeline. scTEP is available at

                  Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have
                  difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a
                  transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of
                  cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori

                  Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal
                  resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq
                  data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the

                  switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors,

                  single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) differentiation trajectories
                  or RNA velocity can reveal causal links between transcription
                  factors and their target genes. However, current GRN inference
                  methods require a total ordering of cells along a linear
                  pseudotemporal axis, which is biologically inappropriate since
                  trajectories with branches cannot be reduced to a single time
                  axis. Such orderings are especially difficult to derive from
                  RNA velocity studies since they characterize each cell’s state
                  transition separately. Here, we introduce Velorama, a novel
                  conceptual approach to causal GRN inference that newly
                  represents scRNA-seq differentiation dynamics as a partial
                  ordering of cells and operates on the directed acyclic graph
                  (DAG) of cells constructed from pseudotime or RNA velocity
                  measurements. In contrast to previous approaches, Velorama is
                  able to work directly with RNA velocity-based cell-to-cell
                  transition probabilities. On a standard set of synthetic
                  datasets, we first demonstrate Velorama’s use with just
                  pseudotime, finding that it improves area under the
                  precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 1.5–3x over state-of-the-art
                  approaches. Using RNA velocity instead of pseudotime as the
                  input to Velorama further improves AUPRC by an additional
                  1.8–3x. We also applied Velorama to study cell differentiation
                  in pancreas, dentate gyrus, and bone marrow from real datasets
                  and obtained intriguing evidence for the relationship between
                  regulator interaction speeds and mechanisms of gene regulatory
                  control during differentiation. We expect Velorama to be a
                  critical part of the RNA velocity toolkit for investigating
                  the causal drivers of differentiation and disease. Software

  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: Testing for correlations between different sets of
                  genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research.
                  However, searching for overlaps between features with existing
                  web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that
                  are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies.
                  Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex
                  questions of these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS: This
                  article introduces a new software suite for the comparison,
                  manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser
                  Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format.
                  BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments
                  in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are
                  extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large
                  datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both
                  public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be
                  combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX
                  commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as
                  pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large
                  genomic datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: BEDTools
                  was written in C++. Source code and a comprehensive user

                  (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in
                  the near future for many functional genomics applications. One
                  of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene
                  expression studies, involves determining whether there is
                  evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are
                  significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR
                  is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential
                  expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson
                  model is used to account for both biological and technical
                  variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the
                  degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the
                  reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even
                  with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least
                  one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The
                  software may have other applications beyond sequencing data,
                  such as proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY: The package

                  provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving
                  multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while
                  still taking full account of biological variation. Biological
                  variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the
                  technical variation associated with sequencing technologies.
                  Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own
                  specific variability, even when there are relatively few
                  biological replicates from which to estimate such variability.
                  The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the
                  Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data
                  demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods
                  (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design,
                  and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The
                  case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific
                  variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across
                  genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and
                  variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with
                  inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on
                  changes that are consistent between biological replicates.
                  Parallel computational approaches are developed to make
                  non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the
                  application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and
                  practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted
                  profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of
                  biological variability in complex situations. When variation
                  is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an
                  advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming
                  common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods
                  developed here can also be applied to count data arising from
                  DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks

                  we sought to connect the structural changes at cis -regulatory
                  elements to alterations in cellular fate and function. To do
                  this we developed PRINT, a computational method that uses deep

                  data and identifies multi-scale footprints of DNA-protein
                  interactions. We find that multi-scale footprints enable more
                  accurate inference of TF and nucleosome binding. Using PRINT
                  with single-cell multi-omics, we discover wide-spread changes

                  cis-regulatory elements controlling gene expression may be the
                  predominant target of natural selection in humans and other
                  species. Detecting selection acting on these elements is
                  critical to understanding evolution but remains challenging
                  because we do not know which mutations will affect gene
                  regulation. Results To address this, we devise an approach to
                  search for lineage-specific selection on three critical steps
                  in transcriptional regulation: chromatin activity,
                  transcription factor binding, and chromosomal looping.
                  Applying this approach to lymphoblastoid cells from 831
                  individuals of either European or African descent, we find
                  strong signals of differential chromatin activity linked to
                  gene expression differences between ancestries in numerous
                  contexts, but no evidence of functional differences in
                  chromosomal looping. Moreover, we show that enhancers rather
                  than promoters display the strongest signs of selection
                  associated with sites of differential transcription factor
                  binding. Conclusions Overall, our study indicates that some
                  cis-regulatory adaptation may be more easily detected at the
                  level of chromatin than DNA sequence. This work provides a
                  vast resource of genomic interaction data from diverse human
                  populations and establishes a novel selection test that will
                  benefit future study of regulatory evolution in humans and

                  Interestingly, age-related, reduced genetic diversity can be
                  identified at the stem cell level and also independently in B
                  cells and T cells. This reduced diversity is most probably
                  related to somatic mutations or to changes in the
                  microenvironmental niche. Either process can select for
                  specific clones or cause repeated evolutionary bottlenecks.
                  This review discusses the age-related clonal expansions in the
                  human HSPC pool, which was termed in the past age-related
                  clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH). ARCH is defined as the gradual,
                  clonal expansion of HSPCs carrying specific, disruptive, and
                  recurrent genetic variants, in individuals without clear
                  diagnosis of hematological malignancies. ARCH is associated
                  not just with chronological aging but also with several other,
                  age-related pathological conditions, including inflammation,
                  vascular diseases, cancer mortality, and high risk for
                  hematological malignancies. Although it remains unclear
                  whether ARCH is a marker of aging or plays an active role in
                  these various pathophysiologies, it is suggested here that
                  treating or even preventing ARCH may prove to be beneficial
                  for human health. This review also describes a decision tree
                  for the diagnosis and follow-up for ARCH in a research

                  retained when chromatin duplicates. In contrast, we find that
                  the Drosophila HSP70 genes rapidly lose histone H3 and acquire
                  variant H3.3 histones as they are induced. Histone replacement
                  does not occur at artificial HSP70 promoter arrays,
                  demonstrating that transcription is required for H3.3
                  deposition. The H3.3 histone is enriched in all active
                  chromatin and throughout large transcription units, implying
                  that deposition occurs during transcription elongation.
                  Strikingly, we observed that the stability of chromatin-bound
                  H3.3 differs between loci: H3.3 turns over at continually
                  active rDNA genes, but becomes stable at induced HSP70 genes
                  that have shut down. We conclude that H3.3 deposition is
                  coupled to transcription, and continues while a gene is
                  active. Repeated histone replacement suggests a mechanism to

                  and the potential for differentiation into new cell types.
                  Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with
                  certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the

  abstract     = {Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) arises when a substantial proportion
                  of mature blood cells is derived from a single dominant
                  hematopoietic stem cell lineage. Somatic mutations in
                  candidate driver (CD) genes are thought to be responsible for
                  at least some cases of CH. Using whole-genome sequencing of 11
                  262 Icelanders, we found 1403 cases of CH by using barcodes of
                  mosaic somatic mutations in peripheral blood, whether or not
                  they have a mutation in a CD gene. We find that CH is very
                  common in the elderly, trending toward inevitability. We show
                  that somatic mutations in TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, and PPM1D are
                  associated with CH at high significance. However, known CD
                  mutations were evident in only a fraction of CH cases.
                  Nevertheless, the highly prevalent CH we detect associates
                  with increased mortality rates, risk for hematological
                  malignancy, smoking behavior, telomere length, Y-chromosome
                  loss, and other phenotypic characteristics. Modeling suggests
                  some CH cases could arise in the absence of CD mutations as a
                  result of neutral drift acting on a small population of active
                  hematopoietic stem cells. Finally, we find a germline deletion

                  gene that predisposes to CH (rs34002450; P = 7.4 × 10-12; odds

                  and the incidence has been rising in recent decades. The
                  clinical and molecular features of hematologic malignancies
                  are highly heterogenous, and some hematologic malignancies are
                  incurable, challenging the treatment, and prognosis of the
                  patients. However, hematopoiesis and oncogenesis of
                  hematologic malignancies are profoundly affected by epigenetic
                  regulation. Studies have found that methylation-related
                  mutations, abnormal methylation profiles of DNA, and abnormal
                  histone deacetylase expression are recurrent in leukemia and
                  lymphoma. Furthermore, the hypomethylating agents and histone
                  deacetylase inhibitors are effective to treat acute myeloid
                  leukemia and T-cell lymphomas, indicating that epigenetic
                  regulation is indispensable to hematologic oncogenesis.
                  Epigenetic regulation mainly includes DNA modifications,
                  histone modifications, and noncoding RNA-mediated targeting,
                  and regulates various DNA-based processes. This review
                  presents the role of writers, readers, and erasers of DNA
                  methylation and histone methylation, and acetylation in
                  hematologic malignancies. In addition, this review provides
                  the influence of microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs on
                  hematologic malignancies. Furthermore, the implication of
                  epigenetic regulation in targeted treatment is discussed. This
                  review comprehensively presents the change and function of
                  each epigenetic regulator in normal and oncogenic
                  hematopoiesis and provides innovative epigenetic-targeted

                  that drive accessibility and those that do not. Deep learning
                  models that learn complex sequence rules provide an
                  unprecedented opportunity to dissect this problem. Using
                  zygotic genome activation in the Drosophila embryo as a model,
                  we generated high-resolution TF binding and chromatin

                  of transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers act to guide

                  epigenetic landscape and promote the generation of specific
                  cell types. The process of B lymphopoiesis requires a set of
                  transcription factors, including Ikaros, PU.1, E2A, and FoxO1

                  major layers of regulation that influence how transcriptional
                  outputs are encoded by DNA sequence and cellular context. We
                  first discuss how transcription factors bind specific DNA

                  ASXL1 in hematopoiesis and myeloid neoplasms is a clinically
                  crucial issue. ASXL1 mutations in hematological neoplasms are
                  typically frameshift or nonsense mutations and occur near the

                  leukemia (AML) has revised diagnostic, prognostic, and
                  therapeutic schemata over the past decade. Recurrently mutated
                  AML genes have functional consequences beyond typical
                  oncogene-driven growth and loss of tumor suppresser function.
                  RECENT FINDINGS: Large-scale genomic sequencing efforts have
                  mapped the complexity of AML and trials of mutation-based
                  targeted therapy has led to several FDA-approved drugs for
                  mutant-specific AML. However, many recurrent mutations have
                  been identified across a spectrum from clonal hematopoiesis to
                  myelodysplasia to overt AML, such as effectors of DNA
                  methylation, chromatin modifiers, and spliceosomal machinery.
                  The functional effects of these mutations are the basis for
                  substantial discovery. SUMMARY: Understanding the molecular
                  and pathophysiologic functions of key genes that exert
                  leukemogenic potential is essential towards translating these
                  findings into better treatment for AML.},

                  deaths. The majority of these mutations are in chromatin and
                  epigenetic regulatory genes (CERGs). CERGs play a key role in
                  regulation of DNA methylation (DNMT3A and TET2) and histone

                  which a hematopoietic stem cell has acquired a survival and

                  nonrandom X inactivation in women, a marker for clonal
                  hematopoiesis. In our pilot study, we tested 127 blood samples
                  from women ≥65 years old without a history of invasive cancer
                  or hematologic malignancies. Applying stringent qualitative
                  criteria, we found that 26\% displayed clonal hematopoiesis;
                  52.8\% displayed polyclonal hematopoiesis; and 21.3\% had
                  indeterminate patterns (too close to call by qualitative
                  assessment). Using Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing,
                  we identified somatic mutations in CERGs in 15.2\% of subjects
                  displaying clonal hematopoiesis (three ASXL1 and two DNMT3A
                  mutations with an average variant allele frequency of 15.7\%,
                  range: 6.3\%-23.3\%). In a more limited sequencing analysis,
                  we evaluated the frequency of ASXL1 mutations by Sanger
                  sequencing and found mutations in 9.7\% of the clonal samples
                  and 0\% of the polyclonal samples. By comparing several recent

                  clonal expansion are commonly acquired during human aging.
                  Clonally restricted hematopoiesis is associated with an
                  increased risk of subsequent diagnosis of myeloid or lymphoid
                  neoplasia and increased all-cause mortality. Although
                  myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are defined by cytopenias,
                  dysplastic morphology of blood and marrow cells, and clonal
                  hematopoiesis, most individuals who acquire clonal
                  hematopoiesis during aging will never develop MDS. Therefore,
                  acquisition of somatic mutations that drive clonal expansion
                  in the absence of cytopenias and dysplastic hematopoiesis can
                  be considered clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential

                  observed in healthy older persons, detection of an
                  MDS-associated somatic mutation in a cytopenic patient without

                  chemotherapy predicts relapse in AML. In this study, we used
                  whole-exome sequencing (WES) and targeted error-corrected
                  sequencing to assess the frequency and mutational patterns of
                  PMD in 30 patients with AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study
                  cohort included 30 patients with adult AML younger than 65
                  years who were uniformly treated with standard induction
                  chemotherapy. Tumor/normal WES was performed for all patients
                  at presentation. PMD analysis was evaluated in bone marrow
                  samples obtained during clinicopathologic remission using
                  repeat WES and analysis of patient-specific mutations and
                  error-corrected sequencing of 40 recurrently mutated AML genes
                  (MyeloSeq). RESULTS: WES for patient-specific mutations
                  detected PMD in 63\% of patients (19/30) using a minimum
                  variant allele fraction (VAF) of 2.5\%. In comparison,
                  MyeloSeq identified persistent mutations above 0.1\% VAF in
                  77\% of patients (23/30). PMD was usually present at
                  relatively high levels (>2.5\% VAFs), such that WES and
                  MyeloSeq agreed for 73\% of patients despite differences in
                  detection limits. Mutations in DNMT3A, ASXL1, and TET2 (ie,
                  DTA mutations) were persistent in 16 of 17 patients, but WES
                  also detected non-DTA mutations in 14 of these patients, which
                  for some patients distinguished residual AML cells from clonal
                  hematopoiesis. Surprisingly, MyeloSeq detected additional
                  variants not identified at presentation in 73\% of patients
                  that were consistent with new clonal cell populations after
                  chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: PMD and clonal hematopoiesis are
                  both common in patients with AML in first remission. These
                  findings demonstrate the importance of baseline testing for
                  accurate interpretation of mutation-based tumor monitoring
                  assays for patients with AML and highlight the need for
                  clinical trials to determine whether these complex mutation
                  patterns correlate with clinical outcomes in AML.},

                  identified recurrent somatic mutations in myeloid neoplasms.
                  An epigenetic regulator, Additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1),
                  is one of the most frequently mutated genes in all subtypes of
                  myeloid malignancies. ASXL1 mutations are also frequently
                  detected in clonal hematopoiesis, which is associated with an
                  increased risk of mortality. Therefore, it is important to
                  understand how ASXL1 mutations contribute to clonal expansion
                  and myeloid transformation in hematopoietic cells. Studies
                  using ASXL1-depleted human hematopoietic cells and Asxl1
                  knockout mice have shown that deletion of wild-type ASXL1
                  protein leads to impaired hematopoiesis and accelerates
                  myeloid malignancies via loss of interaction with polycomb
                  repressive complex 2 proteins. On the other hand, ASXL1
                  mutations in myeloid neoplasms typically occur near the last
                  exon and result in the expression of C-terminally truncated
                  mutant ASXL1 protein. Biological studies and biochemical
                  analyses of this variant have shed light on its
                  dominant-negative and gain-of-function features in myeloid
                  transformation via a variety of epigenetic changes. Based on
                  these results, it would be possible to establish novel
                  promising therapeutic strategies for myeloid malignancies
                  harboring ASXL1 mutations by blocking interactions between
                  ASXL1 and associating epigenetic regulators. Here, we
                  summarize the clinical implications of ASXL1 mutations, the
                  role of wild-type ASXL1 in normal hematopoiesis, and oncogenic
                  functions of mutant ASXL1 in myeloid neoplasms.},

                  20\%, 43\%, 10\%, and 20\% in MDS, CMML, MPN, and AML,
                  respectively. Significantly, ASXL1 mutations are associated
                  with a poor prognosis in all forms of myeloid malignancies.
                  The fact that ASXL1 mutations are associated with poor
                  prognosis in patients with CMML, MDS, and AML, points to the
                  possibility that ASXL1 mutation is a key factor in the
                  development of myeloid malignancies. This review summarizes
                  the recent advances in understanding myeloid malignancies with
                  a specific focus on ASXL1 mutations.},

                  Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq)
                  enable profiling of the epigenetic landscape of thousands of
                  individual cells. scATAC-seq data analysis presents unique
                  methodological challenges. scATAC-seq experiments sample DNA,
                  which, due to low copy numbers (diploid in humans), lead to
                  inherent data sparsity (1-10\% of peaks detected per cell)
                  compared to transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) data (10-45\% of
                  expressed genes detected per cell). Such challenges in data
                  generation emphasize the need for informative features to
                  assess cell heterogeneity at the chromatin level. RESULTS: We
                  present a benchmarking framework that is applied to 10
                  computational methods for scATAC-seq on 13 synthetic and real
                  datasets from different assays, profiling cell types from
                  diverse tissues and organisms. Methods for processing and
                  featurizing scATAC-seq data were compared by their ability to
                  discriminate cell types when combined with common unsupervised
                  clustering approaches. We rank evaluated methods and discuss
                  computational challenges associated with scATAC-seq analysis
                  including inherently sparse data, determination of features,
                  peak calling, the effects of sequencing coverage and noise,
                  and clustering performance. Running times and memory
                  requirements are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: This reference
                  summary of scATAC-seq methods offers recommendations for best
                  practices with consideration for both the non-expert user and
                  the methods developer. Despite variation across methods and
                  datasets, SnapATAC, Cusanovich2018, and cisTopic outperform
                  other methods in separating cell populations of different
                  coverages and noise levels in both synthetic and real
                  datasets. Notably, SnapATAC is the only method able to analyze
                  a large dataset (> 80,000 cells).},

                  development at fetal and adult stages. Comparative analyses of

                  and statistical tests parameterized on non-neoplastic samples.

                  expressed TF Yin-Yang 1 (YY1) binds to both gene regulatory
                  elements and their associated RNA species across the entire
                  genome. Reduced transcription of regulatory elements
                  diminishes YY1 occupancy, whereas artificial tethering of RNA
                  enhances YY1 occupancy at these elements. We propose that RNA
                  makes a modest but important contribution to the maintenance
                  of certain TFs at gene regulatory elements and suggest that
                  transcription of regulatory elements produces a
                  positive-feedback loop that contributes to the stability of
                  gene expression programs.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The histone variant H3.3 is enriched at active
                  regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers in
                  mammalian genomes. These regions are highly accessible,
                  creating an environment that is permissive to transcription
                  factor binding and the recruitment of transcriptional
                  coactivators that establish a unique chromatin
                  post-translational landscape. How H3.3 contributes to the
                  establishment and function of chromatin states at these
                  regions is poorly understood. RESULTS: We perform genomic
                  analyses of features associated with active promoter chromatin
                  in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and find evidence of
                  subtle yet widespread promoter dysregulation in the absence of
                  H3.3. Loss of H3.3 results in reduced chromatin accessibility
                  and transcription factor (TF) binding at promoters of
                  expressed genes in ESCs. Likewise, enrichment of the
                  transcriptional coactivator p300 and downstream histone H3
                  acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) is reduced at promoters in
                  the absence of H3.3, along with reduced enrichment of the
                  acetyl lysine reader BRD4. Despite the observed chromatin
                  dysregulation, H3.3 KO ESCs maintain transcription from
                  ESC-specific genes. However, upon undirected differentiation,
                  H3.3 KO cells retain footprinting of ESC-specific TF motifs
                  and fail to generate footprints of lineage-specific TF motifs,
                  in line with their diminished capacity to differentiate.
                  CONCLUSIONS: H3.3 facilitates DNA accessibility, transcription
                  factor binding, and histone post-translational modification at
                  active promoters. While H3.3 is not required for maintaining
                  transcription in ESCs, it does promote de novo transcription
                  factor binding which may contribute to the dysregulation of
                  cellular differentiation in the absence of H3.3.},

                  the clinical manifestation of anomalies in fetal heart
                  development - a complex process involving dynamic
                  spatiotemporal coordination among various precursor cell
                  lineages. This complexity underlies the incomplete
                  understanding of the genetic architecture of congenital heart
                  diseases (CHDs). To define the multi-cellular epigenomic and
                  transcriptional landscape of cardiac cellular development, we
                  generated single-cell chromatin accessibility maps of human
                  fetal heart tissues. We identified eight major differentiation
                  trajectories involving primary cardiac cell types, each
                  associated with dynamic transcription factor (TF) activity
                  signatures. We identified similarities and differences of
                  regulatory landscapes of iPSC-derived cardiac cell types and
                  their in vivo counterparts. We interpreted deep learning
                  models that predict cell-type resolved, base-resolution
                  chromatin accessibility profiles from DNA sequence to decipher
                  underlying TF motif lexicons and infer the regulatory impact
                  of non-coding variants. De novo mutations predicted to affect
                  chromatin accessibility in arterial endothelium were enriched
                  in CHD cases versus controls. We used CRISPR-based
                  perturbations to validate an enhancer harboring a nominated
                  regulatory CHD mutation, linking it to effects on the
                  expression of a known CHD gene JARID2. Together, this work
                  defines the cell-type resolved cis-regulatory sequence

                  Chromatin modifications are crucial for development, yet
                  little is known about their dynamics during differentiation.
                  Hematopoiesis provides a well-defined model to study chromatin
                  state dynamics; however, technical limitations impede
                  profiling of homogeneous differentiation intermediates. We
                  developed a high-sensitivity indexing-first chromatin
                  immunoprecipitation approach to profile the dynamics of four
                  chromatin modifications across 16 stages of hematopoietic
                  differentiation. We identify 48,415 enhancer regions and
                  characterize their dynamics. We find that lineage commitment
                  involves de novo establishment of 17,035 lineage-specific
                  enhancers. These enhancer repertoire expansions foreshadow
                  transcriptional programs in differentiated cells. Combining
                  our enhancer catalog with gene expression profiles, we
                  elucidate the transcription factor network controlling
                  chromatin dynamics and lineage specification in hematopoiesis.
                  Together, our results provide a comprehensive model of
                  chromatin dynamics during development.},

                  gene expression by changes in chromatin accessibility.
                  However, differentiation is an asynchronous process precluding
                  a temporal understanding of regulatory events leading to cell
                  fate commitment. Here we developed simultaneous
                  high-throughput ATAC and RNA expression with sequencing
                  (SHARE-seq), a highly scalable approach for measurement of
                  chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same single
                  cell, applicable to different tissues. Using 34,774 joint
                  profiles from mouse skin, we develop a computational strategy
                  to identify cis-regulatory interactions and define domains of
                  regulatory chromatin (DORCs) that significantly overlap with
                  super-enhancers. During lineage commitment, chromatin
                  accessibility at DORCs precedes gene expression, suggesting
                  that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime cells for
                  lineage commitment. We computationally infer chromatin
                  potential as a quantitative measure of chromatin
                  lineage-priming and use it to predict cell fate outcomes.

                  understanding of how motif lexicons influence dynamic
                  regulatory activity has been elusive due to the combinatorial
                  nature of the cis-regulatory code. To address this, we
                  undertook multiomic data profiling of chromatin and expression
                  dynamics across epidermal differentiation to identify 40,103
                  dynamic CREs associated with 3,609 dynamically expressed
                  genes, then applied an interpretable deep-learning framework
                  to model the cis-regulatory logic of chromatin accessibility.
                  This analysis framework identified cooperative DNA sequence
                  rules in dynamic CREs regulating synchronous gene modules with
                  diverse roles in skin differentiation. Massively parallel

  abstract     = {Summary Hematopoiesis is arguably one of the best understood
                  stem cell systems; however, significant challenges remain to
                  reach a consensus understanding of the lineage potential,
                  heterogeneity, and relationships of hematopoietic stem and
                  progenitor cell populations. To gain new insights, we
                  performed quantitative analyses of mature cell production from
                  hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multiple hematopoietic
                  progenitor populations. Assessment of the absolute numbers of
                  mature cell types produced by each progenitor cell revealed a
                  striking erythroid dominance of all myeloid-competent
                  progenitors assessed, accompanied by strong platelet
                  reconstitution. All populations with myeloid potential also
                  produced robust numbers of red blood cells and platelets in
                  vivo. Clonal analysis by single-cell transplantation and by
                  spleen colony assays revealed that a significant fraction of
                  HSCs and multipotent progenitors have multilineage potential
                  at the single-cell level. These new insights prompt an
                  erythroid-focused model of hematopoietic differentiation.},
